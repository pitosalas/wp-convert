Costs exposed: Monorepo vs. multirepo - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev),"I’ve never used a large monorepo myself, but they do seem to be the way to go.","In software engineering organizations, there are certain practices that keep costs under control even if those seem more expensive at first. Unfortunately, because such practices feel more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion.
The reason I say seem and not are is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.
To illustrate what I&rsquo;m trying to say, I&rsquo;ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up articles.",https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-monorepo-multirepo.html,"repositories, git, github, monorepo, comparison",2023-08-24T11:47:58.231Z,https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-23-freebsd-gnome-repos.png,

Beginners Guide to Udev in Linux – The Geek Diary,,Udev is really cryptic and advanced. It is often hard to trobuleshoot if you need to. What is it? Udev is the device manager for the Linux kernel. Udev dynamically creates or removes device node files at boot time in the /dev directory for all types of devices. Udev is now part of systemd as you can see by viewing the “udev” file names included with the systemd RPM package.,https://www.thegeekdiary.com/beginners-guide-to-udev-in-linux/,"udev, udev-rules, howto, linux, advanced, robotics",2022-07-10T00:02:33.469Z,https://rdl.ink/render/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegeekdiary.com%2Fbeginners-guide-to-udev-in-linux%2F,

Pascal Piermé | GF Contemporary,,"Artist BioPascal Pierme is a Frenchman who settled in Santa Fe in 1997. Prior to that time, he had gained a European reputation as a promising young sculptor. He fielded a series of solo exhibitions in France and Switzerland, and worked on collaborative projects with Pierre Cardin and others. Pascal's career has blossomed in America. He has been awarded several commissions for large-scale installations. Galleries and collectors alike have responded to the simplicity of his approach, which balances geometric abstraction with organic form. There is an undertone of symbolism as well, a hieroglyphic shorthand that hints at other visual languages. Pascal was influenced from a very young age by his grandfather, a wood sculptor. It was from him that Pascal developed his love for wood and his passion for working with it. He creates an extraordinary range of abstract meditations that seem to arise directly from the material itself, rather than from a conscious plan. He has an extraordinary rapport with his materials, concocting his own varnishes and resins as well as creating bronze-like patinas on non-metallic surfaces. He works with a variety of precious woods and creates sculptures that express the texture, aroma, and strength of each. He considers wood to be a feminine material - warm, colorful, full of surprises, and not always easy to control. Therefore, many of his sculptures have a feminine cast, with elegantly swelling contours and subtle curves. Conversely, he sometimes works with more angular, masculine themes, such as his Fleche (Arrow) series, and the wood responds with a robust presence. Pascal's technique is interactive. Each work of art is characterized by a graceful balance, a meticulous attention to detail. Even as he carves and burnishes, he allows the piece to guide him. Artist’s Statement“Wood has its own intelligence,” he says. “It knows many things, and it teaches them to me. In this way, I understand what I want to do with it, so that the final image reflects its innate qualities as well as my own thoughts and feelings.” - PascalCurriculum Vitae BORN St. Raphael, France 1962 EDUCATION 1975–1980 Art History and Technique, St Raphael, France 1980–1982 Aerograph Technique, San Diego, California SELECTED ART-RELATED Ruinart Champagne Project, Miami, Florida Curatorial “1002 Project” Calvin Charles Gallery, Scottsdale, Arizona ART in Schools, 42 child participants, E.J.

For most users this is something you delay as long as possible as you can generally go for sometime before you have to worry about it. Additionally scaling up your database is often a reasonable approach early on and something I encourage as a starting point as scaling up is easy to do with regards to databases. However, for the 1% of users that do need to shard when the time comes many are left wondering where to start, hence the following guide.",https://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/11/30/sharding-your-database/,"database, sharding, partitioning, scaling, performance",2022-03-23T22:34:40.007Z,https://f.v1.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/0Q1A38191Q0N3G0L413K/Screenshot%2011:29:12%209:45%20AM.png,

Alex Payne — Letter To A Young Programmer Considering A Startup,,"Maybe a startup is the best way to meet a goal, and maybe it isn’t. If the goal of the young man described above is to run a business –&nbsp;any business! –&nbsp;then perhaps a startup is indeed his best path forward. For others, though, I often wonder if they’re fitting their goals into the format of a startup because it’s an approach that’s lauded, admired, and easily understood (if not easily accomplished).",http://al3x.net/2013/05/23/letter-to-a-young-programmer.html,entrepreneurship entrepreneurs startup programmer,2021-04-06T13:40:23.134Z,,
