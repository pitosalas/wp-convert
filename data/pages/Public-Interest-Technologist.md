I recently realized that there's a word for one of the things I do. It's
"Public-Interest Technologist". Modeled after the concept of Public-Interest
Law, I have and will continue to work on behalf of non-profits, charities, and
other public good organizations _pro-bono_ on anything within my area of
expertise. Ranging from simple coding, web site construction all the way to
technology selection, vetting of contractors, or strategy related questions.

If you are interested in my services for the public interest, please send me
an email and I will be glad to make time to find out if I can help.
