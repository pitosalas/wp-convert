[ Using Rust at a startup: A cautionary tale][212] –The author (not me) says:
“Right up front, I should say that Rust is very good at what it’s designed to
do, and if your project needs the specific benefits of Rust (a systems
language with high performance, super strong typing, no need for garbage
collection, etc.) then Rust is a great choice. But I think that Rust is often
used in situations where it’s not a great fit, and teams pay the price of
Rust’s complexity and overhead without getting much benefit.”
