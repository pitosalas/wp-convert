[ Camp Chef Smoke Vault 24″ Review][115] –Many gas smokers have limited
temperature range and can't get down and hold low and slow temps of 225⁰. We
reviewed this big beauty that can go down to 160⁰ and crank up to 400⁰! AND it
converts to natural gas so you don't have to worry about you LP tank running
out. We tested this model and gave it our AmazingRibs.com Platinum Medal.
