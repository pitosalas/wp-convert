[ Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (My Notes and
Highlights)][24] –I recently re-read Martin Fowler's excellent book on
refactoring. It's about improving the design and quality of your code in small
steps, without changing external behavior. The book contains detailed
descriptions of refactorings, with motivation, mechanics, and an example for
each. A must-read.
