[ Regexp Preprocessor][165] –Interesting but not for me. I know regexps are
arcane and confusing but they are well documented and people know them. I put
this in the same bucket as scss and sass and many other helpful pre-
processors. Not for me. Of course, you may not know that C++ started out
literally as a C pre-processor (called cfront) that would generate C. So… The
author says: "Summary of what pomsky is and what it looks like. Pomsky is a
language that compiles to regular expressions. It is currently in an alpha
stage and will likely change in the next few releases."
