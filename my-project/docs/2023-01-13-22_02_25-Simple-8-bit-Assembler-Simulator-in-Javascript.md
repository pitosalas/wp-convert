[ Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator in Javascript][157] â€“One of many simple CPU
simulators. I'm teaching a course in Operating Systems and I've been looking
for a really simple and clear visual simulator for a CPU. This one is the best
one yet. But I would like a better one. This one is missing any kind of
support for IO or System calls or something like that. But it's usable.
