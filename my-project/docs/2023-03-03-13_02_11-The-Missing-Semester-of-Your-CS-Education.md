[ The Missing Semester of Your CS Education][131] –Classes teach you all about
advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but
there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to
students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach
you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy
features of version control systems, and much more!
