is almost in the too good to be true category! “Python has become the most
popular language in many rapidly evolving sectors, such as deep learning and
data sciences. Yet its easy readability comes at the cost of performance. Of
course, we all complain about program performance from time to time, and
Python should certainly not take all the blame. Still, it's fair to say that
Python's nature as an interpreted language does not help, especially in
computation-intensive scenarios (e.g., when there are multiple nested for
loops).”
