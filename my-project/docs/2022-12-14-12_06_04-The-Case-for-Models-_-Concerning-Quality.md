[ The Case for Models | Concerning Quality][184] –An interesting idea, model
based testing. The aurhor says: “Again, I’m writing about models because I
have a deep desire to keep software minimal. While I don’t think it’s wrong to
simply buckle up and deal with the complexity and raw magnitude of
implementations as many of us do, that’s just not the path that I find
appealing intuitively.”
