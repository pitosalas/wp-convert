>> Well we've been **busy little beavers** and are getting ready to release
BlogBridge Beta 2. It has quite a few nifty new features! I will write a
little more about it tomorrow or Monday.

>>

>> We've done a **total overhaul** of the content of the web site (the
look/design is unchanged.) Take a look at [our Brand New Web
Site](<http://www.blogbridge.com.>)

>>

>> An **important change** in opening the kimono a bit more is that you will
find a direct link from our web site to install and run the beta. You are of
course invited to join the beta group, but if you just want to play, go for
it. [Click here to download and run
BlogBridge.](<http://www.blogbridge.com/download.htm>)
