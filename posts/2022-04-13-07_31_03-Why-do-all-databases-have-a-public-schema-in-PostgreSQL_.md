[ Why do all databases have a public schema in
PostgreSQL?](<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134574/why-do-all-
databases-have-a-public-schema-in-postgresql>)

I was just curious why all databases in PostgreSQL have a public schema that
is accessible to all users. I know I can revoke privileges and grant them to
one user but why is that not the default?
