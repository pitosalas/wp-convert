I was recently visiting Curaçao and remembered that I had read that **Netflix
was now available in South America** so I thought I would check it out.
(Curaçao is not technically in South America but close enough!) Well, it
worked.

For one reason or another, I found a british program called "[The
Hour](<http://www.bbcamerica.com/the-hour/>)" which I also remembered having
been positioned as the BBC's answer to
[Madmen](<http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men>). Which it is not.

What it is, is a compelling drama about the creation of an hour long news
program on the BBC in the years following WWII.

So compelling in fact, that we **watched the whole mini-series** (6 or 7
episodes) while we were there. Which you will see, was a _good thing._

__ The story itself is really interesting, but it is also beautifully shot. In
fact the look of it is the one thing that is reminiscent of Madmen. The acting
is also great an the actors and characters are wonderful to watch. So glad we
discovered "The Hour"

Being able to get to Netflix streaming in Curaçao is really cool because TV
there can be uneven, depending on what cable package in available. I am in
Curaçao a lot so this is a nice new option for you world travelers to be aware
of.

Here's a final twist. When I got back to the US, I went onto
[Netflix](<http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Hour/70203479?trkid=2361637>)
to find The Hour NOT available on Netflix!
