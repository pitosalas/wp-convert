Came across this [interesting
article](<http://harpers.org/archive/2007/12/hbc-90001917>). You may agree or
not, but it's definitely interesting:

> "So now the process can be fully diagrammed, and the cast of characters is
> stunning. The torture system involves the operations division of the CIA on
> the implementation side. They rely heavily on contractors, it seems, in
> torturing people. And a special role is apparently played by a couple of
> psychologists. ( **from** [Harper's
> Magazine](<http://harpers.org/archive/2007/12/hbc-90001917>))

p.s. Happy Valentine's Day 🙂
