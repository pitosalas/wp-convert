>> At a level of detail **only a geek could love** reading (or bother
**writing** ), Dan Bricklin gives us an interesting and fun illustrated story
of installing Verizon fiber to his home:

>>

>> "…… Once that was all done, the installer cleaned up all the dropped wire
insulation, empty boxes, etc., and we said goodbye sometime around 4 PM. I
then connected my line to the router and plugged it into my laptop upstairs.
Things work well." ( **from** ["Installing Verizon FIOS fiber-optic Internet
service to my house](<http://www.bricklin.com/fiosinstall.htm>)")

>>

>> I do have one question about the Terms of Service:

>>

>> I ordered the 15Mbps down/2Mbps up service which has a list price of $49.95
a month before the discount. (They also have 5/2 for $39.95 and 30/5 for
$199.95.)Terms of service say they "do not permit customers to host any type
of server, personal or commercial". You know what they mean (maybe) but they
do say it wrong (in an Internet application, each side often plays the part of
a "server" as well as "client" -- they are using lay terms in a legal
document)."

>>

>> **What exactly** does anyone think people will use 2Mbps upstream bandwidth
for?…
