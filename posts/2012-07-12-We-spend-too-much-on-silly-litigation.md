Lucky Me! After **tortured litigation** and lots of legal fees (not mine, of
course), I am receiving a check for $0.47 as my **payout** for the litigation
between Hanson and Google.

What, never heard of Hanson? Well apparently the law suit was about **Google
doing something wrong in how the charged or paid for Google Adwords.** Which I
think I might have used a little some long time ago.

But really, how does it make sense to pay out 47 cents? I am sure the lawyers
(for both sides) are laughing **all the way to the bank!**
