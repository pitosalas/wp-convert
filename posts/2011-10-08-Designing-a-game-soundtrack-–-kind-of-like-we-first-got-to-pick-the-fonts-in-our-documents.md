Can you compose crappy music? I had a field day today 'designing' a bit of
music for my "Game Of Life" Android game. In the old old days, when computers
for the first time allowed you to choose a font for your text. we all became
bad amateur typographers and book designers. Do you remember the "ransom note"
font in the original Macintosh (yeah, that was 1984?) It looked like this:

We loved it and everyone played with it. And there were lots of other ugly
fonts but how did we love them.

Well now (for me) the same thing is happening with music. Yeah I am an amateur
piano and guitar player but designing a sound track is not something I have a
clue about. So I went digging through tools and toys and, more or less like
those early days of customizable fonts, here's what the tools allowed me to
create for my video game.

I have to say it's awful and makes me want to bash my head in but, for your
listening pleasure:
