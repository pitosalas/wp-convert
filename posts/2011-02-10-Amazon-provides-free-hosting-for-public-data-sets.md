If you work with non-profit projects that collect or disseminate large amounts
of public data, you would find this interesting.

[Amazon offers FREE storage for huge public
datasets](<http://aws.amazon.com/datasets>). So in otherwords, Amazon's 'cloud
based' storage service (known as S3) will offer, for no charge, to store a
dataset if it is open to the public and somehow for the public good.

From their site:

> "Public Data Sets on AWS provides a centralized repository of public data
> sets that can be seamlessly integrated into AWS cloud-based applications.
> AWS is hosting the public data sets at no charge for the community, and like
> all AWS services, users pay only for the compute and storage they use for
> their own applications. Learn more about Public Data Sets on AWS and visit
> the Public Data Sets forum." ( **from** [Amazon's Public Data
> Sets](<http://aws.amazon.com/datasets>))
