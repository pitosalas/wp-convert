  * [Crystal is not Ruby Pt. 2 – Runtime Revolution](<https://revs.runtime-revolution.com/crystal-is-not-ruby-pt-2-7c3d988aa9a1>)

Ive been playing around a lot with Crystal. If you're a ruby person you will
really like this for it's compiled binaries. The typing is a big of a mixed
bag but overall I think its helpful.
