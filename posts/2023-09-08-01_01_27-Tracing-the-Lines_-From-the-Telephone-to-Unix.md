[ Tracing the Lines: From the Telephone to Unix](<
https://www.deusinmachina.net/p/history-of-
unix?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post>) –The telephone, invented by
Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, sparked a revolution in communication. A year
later, in 1877, he established the Bell Telephone Company. This marked the
beginning of a fascinating journey, leading to the formation of the Volta
Bureau in 1880. Guided by Bell, the Volta Bureau became a research hub, making
strides in multiple scientific fields.
