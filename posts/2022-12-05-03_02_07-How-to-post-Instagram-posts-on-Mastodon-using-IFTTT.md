[ How to post Instagram posts on Mastodon using IFTTT](<
https://alephnaughtpix.github.io/deadjournal/2019/12/16/how-to-post-instagram-
posts-on-mastodon-using-ifttt.html>) –As you can tell, I've been trying this
and it is a little squirly. But I think I got it to work.

Author says: "A lot of people are starting to join Mastodon these days as an
alternative to Twitter, because of it’s perceived benefits of community and
local moderation over Twitter’s centralised structure and problems with
moderating hate speech and harrasment. (Although, as Sage Sharp notes on
Twitter, this is dependent on picking the right community, or “instance” in
Mastodon, that supports you.) I’m currently on one of the main active instance
of Mastodon to try a few things out before moving to another instance, and one
of the things that I been trying out is seeing if I can post my latest
Instagrams on Mastodon the way I can on Twitter."
