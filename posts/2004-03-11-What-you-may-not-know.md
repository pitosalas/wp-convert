>> **What you may not know about Eclipse. (Demo 2004 Series 10)** If you are a
Java developer and you haven't checked out the Eclipse Development tool from
[www.eclipse.org](<http://www.eclipse.org>), then you owe yourself a treat.
Who knows if you get excited about that kind of thing, but it gives me
_chills._ Here are some claims to fame:

>>  **Back at Demo** 2004 **,**[mValent](<http://www.mvalent.com>)
demonstrated a unique tool for the **configuration and change management** of
complex of n-tier enterprise system deployments. An arcane area to be sure,
but a great product.

>>  **Back to Eclipse though:** For me this product is especially interesting
to me because it illustrates a unique and **little known capability** of the
Eclipse system, which is it's use as a wonderful application framework.
They've done this by abstracting the IDE model to a level where it can be used
for a variety of tools and applications which otherwise would have to start
from scratch.
