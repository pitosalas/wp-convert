>> I recently had occasion to learn all about a really cool
[MMORPG](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG>) ("massively multi player
online role playing game") called [Gaia Online](<http://www.gaiaonline.com/>).

>>

>> Yes, I am not in its demographic, but it was **fascinating** to learn about
how the world of gaming has developed a whole **economic** model in the form
of "[XP" or "Experience
Points"](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point>). Different worlds
use different terms but generically, these are points earned within the game
and then spent on game artifacts or items or abilities.

>>

>> Things get **interesting** when players decide to **cross over** between
the gaming world and the 'real' world and use real money to buy or trade
artifacts.

>>

>> [Here's a fascinating and amusing article
](<http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/January-
February-2006/feature_dibbell_janfeb06.msp>)on that very topic:

>>

>>> "IF YOU HAVEN'T MISSPENT HOURS battling an Arctic Ogre Lord near an Ice
Dungeon or been equally profligate spending time reading the published works
of the Internal Revenue Service, you probably haven't wondered whether the
United States government will someday tax your virtual winnings from games
played over the Internet. The real question is, Why hasn't it happened
already? " ( **from** "[Dragon Slayers or Tax
Evaders?"](<http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/January-
February-2006/feature_dibbell_janfeb06.msp>))
