>> This is an **interim report** on "Life with a [Capresso espresso
maker](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html>)". The topic for today
is what kind of grind of coffee to use. Note that my experience is now about 3
or 4 days so you are learning right along with me.

>>

>> **Basic** lesson, although I haven't fully debugged it yet: **too fine** a
grind ends up blocking the hot water totally, meaning no coffee comes out. (By
the way, I am **not exactly sure** yet whether the water is literally blocked
or is getting diverted into some waste reservoir.)

>>

>> The [Capresso](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html>) which I
bought from [WholeLatteLove](<http://www.wholelattelove.com/>) ( **best**
price, **free** shipping) came with a free pound of coffee beans. Being
perhaps a little **too clever** , I asked my neighborhood
[Starbucks](<http://www.starbucks.com/>) to grind it for me. I **believe** the
ground it too fine, and so I've had several batches of non-coffee - that is,
the machine makes all the right sounds, but nothing comes out.

>>

>> As I mentioned in [my previous post](</weblogs/archives/001144.php>), the
[Capresso Ultima](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html>) has a rather
**clever** way of 'tamping' the coffee which uses a lever (and so muscle
power) but in a way that's simple and fool proof.

>>

>> Well **almost**. The only thing that's not exactly clear is how hard to
push the lever down. Not too **hard**. Not too **soft**. So when **no coffee**
comes out of the nozzle I am left with the **question** : was the grind too
fine, or did I press too hard, or both?

>>

>> I will let you know as I learn more.
