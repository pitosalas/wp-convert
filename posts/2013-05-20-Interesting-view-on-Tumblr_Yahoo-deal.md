[Yahoo, Tumblr, and the Loyalty Factor - Ben Gomes-Casseres - Harvard Business
Review](<http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/05/yahoo_tumblr_and_the_loyalty_f.html>):
a blog post analyzing f some of the strategic issues underlying the
Tumblr/Yahoo deal:

> "…Still, after the initial shock subsides, can Yahoo count on Tumblr users
> staying on? That is probably how the investment bankers framed it -- as a
> question of switching costs, lock-in, network externalities, and the like.
> Where are these users to go? There is no equivalent forum of this type,
> richness, and network size (at least not yet). It would seem that the 18-24
> year-old demographic that Yahoo is pining for does not have an easy exit
> choice…." ( **from:

He also mentions a book - [Exit, Voice, and Loyalty
(Hirshman)](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674276604/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0674276604&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0674276604) - that seems to have
anticipated some of the lock-in, churn and loyalty challenges that
subscription based online services of all kinds face, way back in the 1970's.
Seems like an interesting book, well worth reading:

> "Mr Hirschman's most famous book, "Exit, Voice and Loyalty: Responses to
> Decline in Firms, Organisations and States", remains as suggestive today as
> it was when it first appeared in 1970, for managers and policymakers as well
> as intellectuals. Mr Hirschman argued that people have two different ways of
> responding to disappointment. They can vote with their feet (exit) or stay
> put and complain (voice). Exit has always been the default position in the
> United States: Americans are known as being quick to up sticks and move. It
> is also the default position in the economics profession. Indeed, when his
> book appeared, Milton Friedman and his colleagues in the Chicago School were
> busy extending the empire of exit to new areas. If public schools or public
> housing were rotten, they argued, people should be encouraged to escape
> them." ( **from** : [The
