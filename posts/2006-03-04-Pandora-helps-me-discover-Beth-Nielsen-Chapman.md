>> I've experimented with all kinds of novel music related services and
products.

>>

>> My favorite is [Pandora](<http://www.pandora.com/>). This is a a site that
helps me discover new music that I like. It's introduced me to several artists
that I had never heard of before which are now favorites. In this case I am
plugging **[Beth Nielsen Chapman](<http://bethnielsenchapman.com/>)**. A
wonderful singer songwriter, I think from Europe, that has the sound I really
like. It's quite wonderful to create a Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell or Bill
Evans channel discover new artists.

>>

>> **It 's great!**

>>

>> By the way, also of interest are:

>>

>>   * [Last.FM](<http://Last.FM>) - An application that is supposed to do
something similar. In this case it's integrated with iTunes, and just watches
what you play. Also quite cool, although so far I haven't discovered any new
artists with Last.FM

>>

>>   * [EMusic](<http://www.emusic.com/>) - This is a majorly large music
library (a-la- iTunes store) but with a twist. The music is much much cheaper,
and you get it without any DRM. The catalog is spotty but I have found lots of
music for my iPod at a fraction of the price. And, here's the clincher: they
just gave me 50 songs to download just for trying the service - free of
charge!
