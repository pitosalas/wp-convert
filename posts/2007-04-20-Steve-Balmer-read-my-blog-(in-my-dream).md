I've been setting up a new Windows Vista notebook over the last few days for
use by a non technical user. What a **basket case**. What a disaster. And I am
referring to Vista not the user ðŸ™‚

I've been mentally working on a blog post titled either "Has Microsoft Lost
its mojo" or "Has Microsoft Jumped the shark"?

I have encountered multiple absolutely shockingly and incomprehensibly bad
usability issues. I am making a mental list as I go along. Joel on Software
found one and wrote about it extensively: [read about the design of the "Start
menu" and what it takes to shut down a Vista
computer.](<http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html>) But just to
give you a taste, all the documentation calls that thing the "Start" menu,
except the word "Start" doesn't appear anywhere on or near the menu.

But as I say, that's all material for another post.

**Last night I had a dream** that I worked at Microsoft and Steve Balmer
singled me out in a company meeting, came up to me (with a printout ðŸ™‚ pointing
to the page saying, and "THIS is from YOUR blogâ€¦". I think I might have gotten
fired in the dreamâ€¦
