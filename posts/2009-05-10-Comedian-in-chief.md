You've heard about (or maybe you haven't) President Obama's turn as a comedian
at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. [I was looking for, and
I found the full video of his
remarks.](<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/09/full-video-obamas-white-

In fact, pretty funny. (Who writes for him?)
