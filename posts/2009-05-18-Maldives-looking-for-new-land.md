A while back I wrote a post saying that it was "[Official: The Maldives is the
most beautiful place on earth.](</2005/07/20/ok-its-official-the-maldives-is-
the-most-beautiful-place-on-earth/>)" So you know I have a warm spot for it
(or is it _them?).

_[An article ran in the New York Times Magazine recently,
saying](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/magazine/10MALDIVES-t.html>):

> "[…]Last November, when Nasheed proposed moving all 300,000 Maldivians to
> safer territory, he named India, Sri Lanka and Australia as possible
> destinations and described a plan that would use tourism revenues from the
> present to establish a sovereign wealth fund with which he could buy a new
> country — or at least part of one — in the future. “We can do nothing to
> stop climate change on our own, and so we have to buy land elsewhere,”
> Nasheed said in November.[…]" ( **from** ["A new home for my
> country"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/magazine/10MALDIVES-t.html>))

Wow.
