[ Pmarchive · Pmarca Guide to Career Planning: Skills and education](<
https://fictivekin.github.io/pmarchive-
jekyll//guide_to_career_planning_part2.html>) –Marc Andreeson is a somewhat
legendry technologist. His advice may not fit you, but it is still worth
listeneing to: "Some people argue that college will be your one chance in life
to pursue your passion—to spend four years doing nothing but studying whatever
you love the most, whether that’s Renaissance literature or existential
philosophy.

I disagree."
