First it was [Facebook](<https://www.facebook.com>), then (I think) it was
[Plaxo](<http://pulse.plaxo.com/pulse/>), then LinkedIn, and now
[MyBlogLog](<http://www.mybloglog.com/>) is offering me a way to publicize all
the fascinating stuff I do on other sites. I dunno, there must be 100 other
ones that do it too.Check out [this
post](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/243203058/lifestreaming_comes_to_yahoo.php>)
from [ReadWriteWeb](<http://www.readwriteweb.com/>):

> "The smartly reorganized profiles let you look at an individual's opt-in
> exposed activity on sites like Del.icio.us, Last.fm, YouTube and LinkedIn or
> click over to a view of all their friends' recent activities as well. From
> your profile page it's easy to see what your own friends in this distributed
> social network for blog readers are doing on other social networks. It's a
> very different experience and a lot like other players in the increasingly
> popular lifestreaming market."
