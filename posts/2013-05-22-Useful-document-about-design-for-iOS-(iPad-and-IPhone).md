[Starters Guide to iOS Design](<http://taybenlor.com/2013/05/21/designing-for-
ios.html>):

> As someone who does work on both the development and design side of iOS apps
> I find that many designers struggle with the transition to UI work, or with
> the different processes involved in iPhone and iPad app design. In this
> guide I'll describe the deliverables you'll be expected to produce, outline
> the constraints of the medium and introduce fundamental iOS and UI design
> concepts.
