[ Camp Chef Smoke Vault 24″ Review](< https://amazingribs.com/smoker/camp-
chef-smoke-vault-24-review/>) –Many gas smokers have limited temperature range
and can't get down and hold low and slow temps of 225⁰. We reviewed this big
beauty that can go down to 160⁰ and crank up to 400⁰! AND it converts to
natural gas so you don't have to worry about you LP tank running out. We
tested this model and gave it our AmazingRibs.com Platinum Medal.
