I bet you've not heard of another crazy-cool service from Google, Google Sets.
I first read about Google Sets some months ago but didn't bother looking until
today, Sunday, when i saw this interesting article about [Google Set's
patents.](<http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/03/google-sets-search-engine-
for-lists.html>)

This is from that article:

> "Google Sets is one of the first services that were added to Google Labs and
> it's a cool way to find list of related terms. Google Sets is a tool that
> generates lists from a small number of examples by using the web as a big
> pool of data. You enter some items and Google Sets finds other items that
> tend to co-occur frequently with your examples. For example, you could enter
> Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani and get [a list of US

So, think I, this would be a cool thing to use for competitive analysis. You
know, answering the question, "What other companies are in this space?"

So being of a single track mind, I tried suggesting the following list:
"BlogBridge, Google Reader, Net NewsWire, NewsGator and FeedDemon." Can you
tell what they all have in common? Oh yeah, they are all rss reader /
aggregators, a space that I have wasted too much of my life getting expert on.

[According to Google Sets, the competitors in the space of RSS
reader/aggregators
are](<http://labs.google.com/sets?hl=en&q1=NetNewsWire&q3=Google+Reader&q2=FeedDemon&q5=BlogBridge&q4=Newsgator&btn=Grow+Set>):

> feeddemon, blogbridge, google reader, newsgator, netnewswire, bloglines,
> feedreader, sharpreader, rojo, pluck, newzcrawler, rssowl, jyte, netvibes,
> amphetadesk, awasu, newsburst, pageflakes, google, newsfire, feedster,
> rssreader, rss, feedlounge, 订阅到抓虾, feedburner, yahoo, technorati, feedness,
> firefox, msn, pluckit, newsmonster, aol, bottomfeeder, gougou, sage, myaol  
>

Dang! That's a really good list. All the RSS reader aggregators I know are on
that list, some that I don't know, and a few products which are closely
allied.

Welcome to the new force in competitive analysis!
