>> Here's something I **hadn 't seen before:** I IM'd a friend of mine at a
Big Company and the message got **rejected** because it included a **URL**. I
have to suppose that it's any URL that gets bounced, but who knows?

>>

>> So the **workaround**? I sent the text for a **Google** query that returns
the same url.

>>

>> Further details: Discussing it with him, the logic seems to be that someone
could send an employee a phishing link in an IM message.
