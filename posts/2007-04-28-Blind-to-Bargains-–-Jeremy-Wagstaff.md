> Computers would be nothing without programs to run on them, so why do we

> and so little over the software that makes the bits and pieces do what we
> want them to? And why are we so stingy about paying for software?
>
> These thoughts were running through my mind the other day as I read the
> exchanges on a mailing list devoted to a piece of software I follow closely
> (a thought organizer called PersonalBrain, which I'll be taking a closer
> look at in a forthcoming column). When its creator, California-based Harlan
> Hugh, unveiled the pricing structure of the latest version of the program,
> there was a collective intake of breath among users. One, a doctoral student
> from Florida, exclaimed: "I stopped breathing for few seconds when I read
> the price."
>
> It's true, the jump in price might sound heart-stoppingly steep -- to more
> than three times the cost of the previous version. But we're not talking
> massive amounts of money here -- $250, in fact, which nowadays wouldn't get
> you much more than dinner for two in a posh restaurant. And the people
> balking at shelling out are the same ones who are passionate enough about
> the software to spend their spare time reading and contributing to a mailing
> list entirely devoted to it.
>
> The problem is that we users haven't yet come to terms with what software
> really is. We understand hardware -- wires, chips, silicon, more wires --
> and can see it and touch it. It isn't hard to attach a value to that. But
> software is, well, soft. It's intangible. And we are still struggling to
> grasp the fact that hardware is a commodity, and software isn't. Which
> leaves software and the people who make it in a constant struggle to both
> produce something and find a way of making money from it.
>
> Take Singaporean Joe Goh, for example. Mr. Goh produces a small tool called
> FunkeeStory (funkeemonk.com/funkeestory) that does one thing for one select
> group of people: backs up SMS text messages from a Treo smart phone to a
> Mac. He's been at it full-time for a year now, and is making between one and
> three sales a day. He's just about eking out a living, he says, as long as
> he keeps costs low. He still regrets an early decision: cutting the price
> from $24.95 to $19.95 in the panic of a quiet first week after launching
> last year. Even so, he still gets emails saying his tool is too expensive.
> "That's when it hit me," he says. "No matter [at what level] I price my
> software, there will always be people out there complaining."
>
> All the free software out there puts further pressure on prices. No one
> today, for example, is going to pay for a browser, because you can get good
> ones free. Part of the blame lies with Microsoft, which has long given away
> its Internet Explorer. But the Open Source movement -- where volunteers
> contribute to writing software that is then usually made available to users
> gratis -- has also contributed with its Firefox browser.
>
> It isn't as if people aren't making money out of software: Microsoft still
> charges an arm and a leg for its Office Suite: between $250 and $350 in the
> mid-1990s, against $150 to $680 now. Others have switched to different
> pricing models. McAfee VirusScan, for example, was a very popular antivirus
> program in the mid-'90s, selling for a one-time price of $65. Now people
> cough up the same price every year for a subscription.
>
> The rise of Web-based applications that sit in your browser is also
> supporting the idea that software should, at least for simple tasks, be
> free. Google offers basic word processing and spreadsheet applications
> online at no charge, while other companies, like developer 37 Signals with
> its collaboration tool Highrise (www.highrisehq.com), offer free basic
> versions of Web-based programs and charge for advanced features like storage
> or sharing.
>
> I have no quarrel with this kind of innovation. And the more stuff that's
> available without shelling out a lot of cash, the better for us as users.
> But I suspect that, too, it reinforces a growing perception that software is
> an entitlement, something we just grab out of the refrigerator when we need
> it. It isn't: It's the lifeblood that flows through the veins of our
> devices. We need to recognize that what we get out of our machines is nearly
> all due to software, and the brains that created and that maintain it
> require food to keep doing so. Sure, the likes of Microsoft probably don't
> need every one of us to shell out $600 for Office. But the real innovators
> have always been small artisanal developers, beavering away in obscurity and
> hoping to make a living. If we keep thinking that software is something that
> should be free, then, in the words of Singapore-based software developer
> Bernard Teo, we may find that there aren't many of those people around: "If
> a developer is not careful, he may find that it's simply not worth his time
> building and supporting his product, if consumers continue to expect low,
> low prices without limit."
>
> Next time you balk at paying $30 for a program, think about how little that
> really is.
