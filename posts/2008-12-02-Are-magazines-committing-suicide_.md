title: "Are magazines committing suicide?"

I was traveling this weekend and as I am wont to do, spent too much time at
bookstores and magazine stands.

I came across the current issue of the New Yorker, where this article caught
my eye: "[A reporter at Large: Anatomy of a
Meltdown"](<http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/01/081201fa_fact_cassidy?printable=true>),
and the current issue of Wired, where this article caught my eye: "[Ray Ozzie
wants to Push Microsoft Back into Startup Mode".
](<http://www.wired.com/print/techbiz/people/magazine/16-12/ff_ozzie>)

I haven't read either article yet, but a cursory scan says that they are
**just the kind of thing I am interested in**. Just the thing I'd be willing
to pay for. Here's the thing. I thought about buying them (probably $10 total)
but instead, back at my hotel, in the lobby, logged onto the **free** internet
and printer connected computer, and **printed out both articles** , stapled
them (handy stapler provided by hotel) and took them to my room.

I like this, as a reader. But the fact that the magazines make these articles
available, **free, in full text, without ads even** (check the links I privide
and you will see no ads!), tells me something. I have to believe that the
editors know that these are some of their most catchy articles, and that they
didn't end up on the web site by accident. I have to believe that they are
there only after a good bit of soul searching around the editorial desk.

It's sad to see, but I take this as a sign that magazines (and newspapers) are
on their deathbed.
