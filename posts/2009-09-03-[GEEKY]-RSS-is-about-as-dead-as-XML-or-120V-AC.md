I've seen a couple of "[RSS is dead](<http://www.pehub.com/49053/rss-is-dead-
so-is-the-rss-fund/>)" headlines in the last few days, and even though I am on
vacation I couldn't resist a quick post.
[Googling](<http://www.google.com/search?q=rss+is+dead&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a>), I see it's actually something that has been
[floating around for a few months](<http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=23276>). My
2 cents:

RSS is so thoroughly part of the plumbing now, there's no way it's gonna die.
All kinds of applications, web sites, humongous services are totally reliant
on RSS, it's just that you don't see it anymore. Sort of like XML is
everywhere and of course, at least here in the USA, 120V AC, electricity, is.
