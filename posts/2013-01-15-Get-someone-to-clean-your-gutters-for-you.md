I am not being metaphorical, in fact, I am talking about gutters on your roof.
A few years ago I wasn't regularly cleaning my gutters and had a close call
with roof leaks when we had an extensive period of rain and freezing that
caused ice dams and all kinds of ugliness to many New England residents as
well as friends of mine. I had a scare and since then I've been paying someone
to clean my gutters each year.

Here's a far more 2013 solution to the same problem. Yes, Robots are no longer
just for sweeping your living room!
