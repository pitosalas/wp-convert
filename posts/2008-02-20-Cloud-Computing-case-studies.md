I've written about some of the [considerations that go into the choice between
physical infrastructure and new SAAS services such as Amazon's S3 and
EC2](</2008/02/18/about-amzn-and-cloud-computing/>). I also covered [why the
fact that you are comfortable relying on a hosting provider for rack mounted
servers (so called ping & power) doesn't mean necessarily that you would come
to the same conclusion about SAAS services.](</2008/02/19/about-amzn-and-
cloud-computing-continued>)

Here's what the Wall Street Journal had to say about that tradeoff just a few
days ago:

> "Today was a bad day for a new computing model that could one day be the
> norm. Amazon’s S3 service –which companies can use to rent data storage on
> Amazon’s tech gear — [crashed this
> morning](<http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/02/amazons_s3_util.php>),
> knocking many small businesses offline and highlighting one of the model’s
> drawbacks: You’re putting your operations in somebody else’s hands." (

> Computing?](<http://blogs.wsj.com/biztech/2008/02/15/is-amazons-small-crash-
> a-giant-crash-for-cloud-computing/?mod=homeblogmod_businesstechnology>))

In researching these three posts, I came across this which reminded me that
this wasn't the first time this happened, I guess not surprisingly:

> "Cautionary tale indeed. It’s the other side of the wonderful world of
> mashups and web 2.0 and web services and all that jazz. If I build my

> position to be in." ( **from** [A cautionary utility computing tale - or the
> dark side of Mashups](</2007/01/06/a-cautionary-utility-computing-tale-or-
> the-dark-side-of-mashups/>))
