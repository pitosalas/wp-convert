**Link: [Area codes become meaningless](None):** ""

A [good little insight from Rafe Needleman ](<http://reviews-
zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7297_16-5129645.html>)in his new column over at
ZDNet.

>>

>> _" The reason it won't last: If you can get a telephone with any area or
country code, the whole idea of a vanity area code will eventually evaporate.
It won't be like a real-world address, which for the most part still
represents a physical location. While roaming cellular phones have already
begun to make area codes irrelevant, VoIP will finish the job. Soon, area code
will be one of those anachronistic telecom terms, like dialing, that doesn't
mean anything close to what it once did. "_
