>> One of the core goals of [BlogBridge ](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)is to
give a newbie a quick and delicious taste of the world of blogs. One of the
very first steps of course is to decide what feeds to follow. Other blog
readers come with an initial set of feeds built in or offer the user to pick
from a bunch of them. (I hear that the authors of those readers, once they
become at all well known, are inundated with bloggers who would like their
particular blog to be in the built-in initial list.

>>

>> Here's a different approach. In BlogBridge I want allow a user to use
someone else's subscription list as a base for their own. In other words, give
me a subscription list that matches Jon Udell's. Or like George Bush. Or like
Eric Clapton.

>>

>> There actually is a fairly straightforward way of doing this, [using Dave
Winer's Share Your OPML
service](<http://feeds.scripting.com/whatIsOpml#usingOpmlToExchangeSubscriptionLists>).
This is a place where willing participants can publish their own personal RSS
reading list for others to look at and use.

>>

>> From my reading [of the fair use
guidelines](<http://feeds.scripting.com/sdk>), this use of the OPML is
legitimate and fair. Still, before proceeding I will verify that using the
Share Your Opml SDK for this purpose does not violate the spirit or letter of
the rules.
