**Link: [Review: The Panasonic FZ1000 II combines versatility and value](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dc-fz1000-ii-review/3):** "The Panasonic FZ1000 II is a worthy successor to the company's first large-sensor, long-zoom bridge camera, and a value-conscious rival to the popular Sony RX10-series. It's just as fast as its predecessor but produces nicer JPEGs, has significantly improved controls and interface, and more."
