content/uploads/imagewell//paradise.jpg?resize=198%2C331)I just returned from
[RailsConf](<http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home>), a
conference all about **Ruby on Rails**. Many bloggers have [written about
it](<http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/feed/89>) so I won't summarize it further.
In the coming days I will be posting on various of my discoveries and contacts
made.

For today though I want to just direct your attention to the picture on the
left. After the conference (which was in [Portland
Oregon](</2008/06/01/portland-or-smokes/>)) we drove to Seattle and spent one
full day in [Mount Rainier National Park](<http://www.nps.gov/mora/>).

This was around June 3d. We stayed at the [Paradise
Inn.](<http://rainier.guestservices.com/>)

The Paradise Inn is at 5,000â€² elevation.

I knew it wasn't going to be warm, and we brought our winter coats. But we
were surprised by the **30 foot snow banks!**

Yes, that's me in the picture ðŸ™‚
