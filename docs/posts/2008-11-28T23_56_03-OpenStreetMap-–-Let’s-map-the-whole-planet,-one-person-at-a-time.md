Another crazy-brilliant site, [OpenStreetMap.org, is aiming to get all of us
to annotate maps of all places on the
planet](<http://www.openstreetmap.org/index.html>). In other words, I know my
neighborhood, let me log in and indicate what streets are called what, which
ones are one way, where the intersections are etc. This may not sound so
special if you live in Boston, or any other relatively built up part of the
world.

But for [out of the way
places](<http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=12.156&lon=-68.807&zoom=10&layers=B000FTF>)
where, one might presume, the bigco's have not yet come through to annotate
the sattelite photos, it sets up a rather cool, people powered way of
capturing this information.

From their own wiki:

> "OpenStreetMap creates and provides free geographic data such as street  
> maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most  
> maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions  
> on their use, holding back people from using them in creative,  
> productive, or unexpected ways."

And very likely the results will be more up to date, more detailed and more
accurate.
