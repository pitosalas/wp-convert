This New York Times article, "[What's Obscene? Google Could Have an
Answer"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/technology/24obscene.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin>)
is pretty interesting, and makes sense at some level:

> "Judges and jurors who must decide whether sexually explicit material is
> obscene are asked to use a local yardstick: does the material violate
> community standards?" ( **from** "[What's
> Obcene](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/technology/24obscene.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin>)?")

and then:

> "In a novel approach, the defense in an obscenity trial in Florida plans to
> use publicly accessible
> [Google](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-
> org> "More information about Google Inc") search data to try to persuade
> jurors that their neighbors have broader interests than they might have
> thought." ( **from** "[What's
> Obcene](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/technology/24obscene.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin>)?)

Read the whole article, it's quite interesting. Do you think this is a
reasonable judicial approach?
