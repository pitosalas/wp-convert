**Link: [Amazing Stuxnet story](None):** ""



With apologies for quoting a [Foxnews](<http://www.foxnews.com>) story, and
with thanks to [Scott Adams](<http://dilbert.com/blog/>) for the link, here's
a fascinating behind the scenes story of Stuxnet:

> "The mission: Infiltrate the highly advanced, securely guarded enemy
> headquarters where scientists in the clutches of an evil master are secretly
> building a weapon that can destroy the world. Then render that weapon
> harmless and escape undetected." ( **from** [Mystery Surrounds Cyber Missile
> That Crippled Iran's Nuclear Weapons
> Ambitions](<http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/11/26/secret-agent-crippled-
> irans-nuclear-ambitions/>))

and how well did it work?

> "“We brought it into our lab to study it and even with precautions it spread
> everywhere at incredible speed,” Byres said." ( **from** [Mystery Surrounds
> Cyber Missile That Crippled Iran's Nuclear Weapons
> Ambitions](<http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/11/26/secret-agent-crippled-
> irans-nuclear-ambitions/>))
