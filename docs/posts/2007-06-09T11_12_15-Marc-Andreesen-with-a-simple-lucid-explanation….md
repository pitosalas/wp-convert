new business. From what I know of the way the world is and works, I generally
agree with his article. Heres a bit from the [this
post](<http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about.html>) in
[blog.pmarca.com](<http://blog.pmarca.com/>):

> "[snip…] Startups that have a **credible potential** to be sold or go public
> for a 10x gain on invested capital within 4 to 6 years of the date of
> funding should consider raising Venture Capital.Most **other** startups
> should not raise venture capital. This includes: startups where the founders
> want to stay private and independent for a long time; startups where there's
> no inherent leverage in the business model that could result in a 10x gain
> in 4 to 6 years; and startups working on projects with a longer fuse than 4
> to 6 years. Notably, there are many fine businesses in the world -- many of
> them highly profitable, and very satisfying to run -- that do not have
> leverage in their model that makes them suitable for venture capital
> investment.[…snip]"
