>> You've heard me [complain](<http://weblogs>) about
[comment](</weblogs/archives/000570.html>) spam before haven't you? Comment
Spam is when mysterious robot software attacks my blog and floods it with fake
comments?

>>

>> I came across this [handy little
document](<http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/comment_spam>) from Six Apart, the
makers of Movable Type, the Blog software I use: ["Six Apart Guide to Comment
Spam](<http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/comment_spam>)":

>>> "This document describes how malicious or unwanted comments ('comment
spam') affect weblogs, the techniques spammers use to abuse weblogs, and the
tactics that can be used to prevent and defend against these attacks. Also
included is a review of the strengths and weaknesses of each tactic,
instructions for implementing them on your weblog and ones which we recommend
for the best protection."

>>

>> Well it should be called of course, the "Six Apart Guide to **defeating**
comment spam" but at any rate, I found a tip there which, for now, seems to
have dealt with the problem. If you use Movable Type you might be interested
in the techniques.
