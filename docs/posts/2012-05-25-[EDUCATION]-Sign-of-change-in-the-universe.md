I would love to see this trend accelerate:

> "The five-year-old [Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship] program,

This is really important in my opinion, and it's a big part of what we cover
in the [course I am co-teaching at Brandeis this year, "Web and Social
Apps".](<https://sites.google.com/site/jbs2012cosiwebsocial/>) The course
starts next week and runs for 10 weeks, practically full time. During that
course students go through the whole cycle of conceiving a product, designing,
implementing and deploying it to the world. It's an exciting experience.
Fairly exhausting for everyone involved, but worth it.

I wish all college students, especially in my field, Computer Science, were
thought learn theory and critical thinking, **but also got exposed** (and were
even required) to learn what I like to call " **critical doing "**. Working in
teams, inventing and creating things that others could benefit of, could touch
and feel, and could have an impact in the real world.

The truth is that in many Universities, this is not a priority today, but
there is signs that the students and parents (the customers after all) are
demanding this. Change is slow, but it is coming.
