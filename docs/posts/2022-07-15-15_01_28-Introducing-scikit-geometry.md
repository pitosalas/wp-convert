[ Introducing scikit-geometry](< https://wolfv.medium.com/introducing-scikit-
geometry-ae1dccaad5fd>) –One of those libraries that I was going to write,
then I thought, someone else must have already written it. Then I googled and
found: "The Python ecosystem is lacking a library with useful geometric types
— we aim to fix this by introducing scikit-geometry."
