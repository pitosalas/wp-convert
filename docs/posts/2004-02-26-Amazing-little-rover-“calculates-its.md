>>> Opportunity also updated its "attitude knowledge," which fine-tunes the

then smart enough to take the Sun movement data collected from the panoramic
camera to calculate its own location in the universe…..on Mars.

astronomy, orbitall mechanics, geology, physics, and who knows what other
basic science that determines the core algorithms. Hats off to the team who
built it.
