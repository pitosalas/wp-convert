>> **I 'm not *that* geeky: **I am totally fascinated and entralled with

recently came across this [blog by Susan

the meanwhile here are some other links that I follow for Mars news: [Steve
Squires, the "principal investigator" of the mission actually has a
blog.](<http://athena.cornell.edu/news/>) And of course [Nasa/JPL has a web
site of their own](<http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html>) with news
and some amazing animations.
