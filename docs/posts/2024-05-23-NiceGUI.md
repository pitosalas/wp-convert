**Link: [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/#about):** "NiceGUI is an easy-to-use, Python-based UI framework, which shows up in your web browser. You can create buttons, dialogs, Markdown, 3D scenes, plots and much more." 

I haven't tried it but it looks amazing. We always love to see new and better Python APIs.
