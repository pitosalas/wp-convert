**Link: [Deckset for Mac: Presentations from Markdown in No Time](https://www.deckset.com/):** "Write down your thoughts in your favourite text editor, and Deckset will turn them into beautiful presentations."

I was looking for a nice package to create slides using markdown files. This one is very nice except it cannot export to straight html/css/js. But other than that, I do recommend it!
