I say, **hooray for us! Hooray for the USA.** Why can't we just be **proud**
that our president was given this honor, instead of [people taking potshots at
him for 'not having accomplished anything'

It's silly. There have been many Nobel Peace Prizes awarded to encourage and
support an effort, even before it has yielded results. I suppose if we look

nonsense.[](<http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/10/10/a_prize_thats_also_for_us/>)
