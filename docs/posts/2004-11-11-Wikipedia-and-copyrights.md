>> If you haven't heard about
[Wikipedia](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>), you should check it
out. It's a grass roots encyclopedia. It has a huge number of articles,
contributed in general by anyone who feels like writing an article, presumably
because they know something about it. [Here's the Wikipedia definition of
Wikipedia.](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia>)

>>

>> It's quite an **amazing** thing, amazing because of how it has grown, how
it was built, who built it and what it was built on.

>>

>> One often mentioned question is **how accurate is Wikipedia anyway**?. It's
an important question in that Wikipedia is developing quite a reputation, not
only among Technorati, but also among civilians. I am waiting for the first
time that a Wikipedia definition is cited in the New York Times. It may have
already happened.

>>

>> I was looking for a random snippet of information today (you'll see how
random in a second!) Anyway, I Googled it, which produced quite a list of
hits, including a [Wikipedia
definition](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_\(musical\)>) and a
["Freedictionary.com"](<http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Hair%20\(musical\)>)
definition (which I had not heard of before.)

>>

>> Guess what: they are **copies of each other**! Just check the two links!

>>

>> The question is, **what direction** was the copying done? Impossible to
tell, but I was actually surprised to randomly stumble onto something like
that. I don't want to make this into a big **conspiracy theory** - there may
be a perfectly innocent explanation…
