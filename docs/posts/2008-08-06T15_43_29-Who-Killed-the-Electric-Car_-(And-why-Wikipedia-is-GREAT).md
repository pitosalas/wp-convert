I just saw the [movie "Who Killed the Electric
Car"](<http://www.sonyclassics.com/whokilledtheelectriccar/>) which makes a
**pretty compelling** case that years ago General Motors had a **working and
practical** electric car which they took off the market under what are
portrayed as **suspicious circumstances**.

It's an interesting movie but part of me, while never **underestimating the
corruption and incompetence** in government and industry, still felt like
there must be another side of the story.

Here's an [article in Wikipedia about the film "Who Killed The Electric
Car"](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F>) and
evidence in support and opposition to the case made in the movie. While one
might quibble similarly with the Wikipedia article, it is replete with
references and links to other sites which tell other sides of the story.

Interesting.
