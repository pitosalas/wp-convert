is always a favorite of mine. Here's another good op-ed piece, and this time,
showing that I am fair and balanced, it's not positive about Barack Obama and
contains some useful insights ðŸ™‚

> pull off well. The president will be talking, essentially, to three groups:
> the political elites of both parties and the media, his supporters on the
> ground, and highly informed citizens who are already either for or against
> the plan but want to hear, ponder and form an opinion on the speech."
