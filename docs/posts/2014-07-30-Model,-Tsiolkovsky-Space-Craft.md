Check out some really cool images: Soviet model makers built this spacecraft
based on the designs and notes of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Late in his life,
much of Tsiolkovsky's theoretical work focused on ideas about transporting
humans into space on board rockets. Although this model, reflecting the
scientist's ideas, grossly overestimates the living space available on board a
rocket, it does convey a sophisticated understanding of the physical
constraints of space travel for that time. Among Tsiolkovsky's concerns were
the effects of acceleration and weightlessness on the human body.
