Continuing my linking to Election related news, check out this post [Diebold
Touch-Screen Voting Machine Hacked by Remote Control With $26 in Computer
Parts](<http://www.bradblog.com/?p=8785>) from [The BRAD
BLOG](<http://www.bradblog.com/?feed=rss2>):

> "What makes this hack so troubling -- and different from those which have
> come before it -- is that it doesn't require any actual changes to, or even
> knowledge of, the voting system software or its memory card programming.
> It's not a cyberattack. It's a "Man-in-the-middle" attack where a tiny,
> $10.50 piece of electronics is inserted into the system between the voter
> and the main circuit board of the voting system allowing for complete
> control over the touch-screen system and the entire voting process along
> with it."
