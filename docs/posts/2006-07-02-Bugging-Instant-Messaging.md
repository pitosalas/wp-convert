# [Bugging Instant Messaging](None)



>>

>> I just walked by a room full of people working on computers during a [break
between presentations ](<http://www.gnomedex.com/>)and over in a corner I saw
one fellow **furiously** instant messaging, his fingers **flying** across the
keyboard in a very **animated** way. I had a **sense** of what he might be
**chatting** about and I had this **subversive** thought: what if I could bug
IM conversations?

>>

>> And as these thoughts go, I couldn't help musing about how one might
actually do this.

>>

>> **Well** we are here with 400 of our closest friends, with about 350 of us
with laptop computers, all on an unsecure wireless network. Hmm. Interesting
