>> **Outlook 2003 Rant.** What were those guys thinking? Don't get me wrong, I
am **not one of those Microsoft haters**. I love Microsoft. I admire their
work. But in this instance, and one that affects me directly and daily, boy do
**I feel let down**!

>> I've been using Outlook 2003 for a few months now. While it has some nice
new features, the one feature I use the most and arguably the most important
because of its prominence is so-called _' Navigation Pane.'_ Not to rub salt
in the wound,**but, why, oh, why**

>>   * Can't I hide the 'All Mail Folders' panel?

>>   * Doesn't the 'All Mail Folders' Panel preserve its collapse state?

>>   * Can't I look at my Tasks along side my Calendar like I could in Outlook
XP?  
>
>>   * Can't I make sure that the 'Current View' Panel doesn't disappear?

>> I remember a few years ago speaking to a Microsoft friend of mine who was a
Program Manager who said, of the old 'Outlook Bar' - "we know it stinks; **we
are completely redesigning it! "** Yikes.

>> And now I have to **wait another 4 years** for the next 'redesign' 🙁

chest.)
