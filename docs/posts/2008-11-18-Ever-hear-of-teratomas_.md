Here's a [truly weird
article](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/magazine/09wwln-
diagnosis-t.html?ref=magazine>), which a sticks in my mind a week after
reading it:

> "Clark had seen teratomas. They were common in the reproductive tract, often
> found accidentally in the course of an operation or on a scan done for some
> other reason.
>
> These strange cysts have been a source of fascination since their discovery
> in the 19th century because, although smooth and normal-appearing on the
> outside, on the inside they often contain hair and teeth and other tissues
> not normally seen in the reproductive system.
>
> The name “teratoma” is derived from the Greek word for “monster,” because of
> their creepy contents. These cysts rarely cause trouble and are usually
> removed only if they get too large or cause pain. This cyst was the size of
> a peach pit. Could a small growth do all this?" (from [Brain
> Drain](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/magazine/09wwln-
> diagnosis-t.html?ref=magazine>))
