I am often asked what technology someone should use to create their web
presence. I know Ruby on Rails well, but I often also recommend checking out
Drupal. I know much less about Drupal but I know its reputation and I know its
track record. So I've felt comfortable with my view. But, check this post
[Content Management Systems just don't
work.](<http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2009/02/23/content-management-systems-
just-dont-work/>) from [Sunlight Labs
blog](<http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/feeds/latest/>):
