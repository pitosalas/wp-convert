Check out [this post](<http://herot.typepad.com/cherot/2007/09/the-long-
tail-o.html>) about the distribution of Facebook applications on [Christopher
Herot's Weblog:](<http://herot.typepad.com/cherot/>)

> As of today, there are 3,593 applications listed on
> [Facebook](<http://www.facebook.com/>). The most popular, [Top
> Friends](<http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2425101550&b&ref=pd>),
> has 2.4 million active daily users, and there are half a dozen more that
> have at least half a million users, but the usage drops off rapidly after
> that. The curve looks like the familiar [long
> tail](<http://www.thelongtail.com/>), but only if one plots it on a log
> scale (right). If one looks at the area under the curve, the 41 applications
> that have between 100,000 and a million users account for 11 million users
> total. (Of course, there is duplication as most users have more than one
> application installed). At the bottom, 2,500 applications have less than 100
> users and 218 apps have no daily usage at all.
