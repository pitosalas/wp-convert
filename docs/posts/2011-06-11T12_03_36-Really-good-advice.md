[Robert Krulwich gave this graduation
speech](<http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/05/12/“there-
are-some-people-who-don’t-wait-”-robert-krulwich-on-the-future-of-
journalism/>). While it is aimed at Journalism students, it has some good
stories:

> "As I say, he was a news writer, writing copy off in a corner, sometimes for
> Murrow, but he’s pretty much an indoors guy, and he’s dreaming of course, of
> getting outdoors where things are happening and one night – in the middle of
> the night, on the graveyard shift, two a.m.—the bell on the wire ticker goes
> off and says an airplane has just fallen short of the runway at LaGuardia
> Airport and is sinking in the East River, right now." (from [Robert Krulwich

That story is about Charles Kuralt. You will have to read the
[speech](<http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/05/12/“there-
are-some-people-who-don’t-wait-”-robert-krulwich-on-the-future-of-
journalism/>) to see how it ends.

The speech also has lots of good advice, for anyone:

> Suppose, instead of waiting for a job offer from the New Yorker, suppose
> next month, you go to your living room, sit down, and just do what you love
> to do. If you write, you write. You write a blog. If you shoot, find a
> friend, someone you know and like, and the two of you write a script. You
> make something. No one will pay you. No one will care, No one will notice,
> except of course you and the people you’re doing it with. But then you
> publish, you put it on line, which these days is totally doable, and then…
> you do it again." (from [Robert Krulwich graduation
