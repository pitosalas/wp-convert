](<https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/wp-
content/uploads/imagewell//skypeslow.jpg>)Upon updating to the latest Mac OS X
10.5, a.k.a Leopard, I noticed that Skype was ridiculously slow, hanging and
doing other ugly things. A search of the web didn't find any useful ideas, at
least that worked for me.

Here's what fixed it. In Skype "General Preferences" there's an option to
"Show Address Book Contacts".

Well I have a fairly huge address book - about 3000 people. Somehow Skype was
driving itself crazy trying to show them.

**Unclicking the "Show Address Book Contacts" check box solved it for me.**
