Some choice quotes to introduce a good [lecture about
Engineering](<http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/Augustine.htm>):

> '…[snip], Napoleon dismissed Robert Fulton's claim of a steam-powered ship:
> "What, sir, would you make a ship sail against the wind and currents by
> lighting a bonfire under her deck? I pray you excuse me. I have no time to
> listen to such nonsense."
>
> Or consider the pronouncement of Dr. Dionysus Lardner, professor at
> University College in London, on the prospects of a new form of
> transportation: "Rail travel at high speed is not possible because
> passengers, unable to breathe, would die of asphyxia."
>
> Or hear the opinion of the commander of the army's cavalry in 1938, just
> before World War II: "We must not be misled to our detriment to assume that
> the untried machine can displace the proved and tried horse."
>
> Or listen to a great aviator speaking about the profession: "Flying machines
> will eventually be fast; they will be used in sport but they should not be
> thought of as commercial carriers."' ( **from** [1996 Woodruff Distinguished
> Lecture by Norman
> Augustine](<http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/Augustine.htm>))

If you are an engineer or interested in the topic, the lecture has some great
lessons.
