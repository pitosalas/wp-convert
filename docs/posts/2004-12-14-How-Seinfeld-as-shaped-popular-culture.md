# [How Seinfeld as shaped popular culture](None)



>>

>> In this morning's Blog reading, I saw two references to Seinfeld episodes,
in each case the reference was just thrown into a headline without further
comment. Shows how Seinfeld has shaped how we think and speak!

>>   * ["No WinFS For You" ](<http://pbokelly.blogspot.com/2004/12/microsoft-
updates-windows-server.html>)referering to the totally famous Soup Nazi
episode.

>>   * ["A Festivus for the rest of us",
](<http://weblogs.asp.net/jledgard/archive/2004/12/13/284205.aspx>)from the
little less well known Festivus episode.
