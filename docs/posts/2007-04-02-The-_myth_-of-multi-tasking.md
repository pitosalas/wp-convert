**Link: [The *myth* of multi-tasking](None):** ""



I sometimes feel like I don't multi-task quite as well as "everyone else". So
I was interested in [this
post](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/43Folders/~3/104476049/>) from [43
Folders](<http://www.43folders.com>):

>> The productivity lost by overtaxed multitaskers cannot be measured
precisely, but it is probably a lot. Jonathan B. Spira, chief analyst at
Basex, a business-research firm, estimates the cost of interruptions to the
American economy at nearly $650 billion a year…

>> The information age is really only a decade or two old in the sense of most
people working and communicating on digital devices all day, Mr. Spira said.
In the industrial era, it took roughly a century until Frederick Winslow
Taylor in 1911 published his principles of “scientific management” for
increasing worker productivity.

>>

>> “We don’t have any equivalent yet for the knowledge economy,” Mr. Spira
said.
