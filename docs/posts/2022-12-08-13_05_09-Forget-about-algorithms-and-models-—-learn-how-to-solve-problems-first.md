[ Forget about algorithms and models — learn how to solve problems first](<
https://thenextweb.com/news/forget-about-algorithms-and-models-learn-how-to-
solve-problems-first>) –An interesting article, stating the obvious. This is
highly relevant to someone who teaches college students their in their very
first year of learning programming. And yet it is still a subject of debate
among my colleagues. Heres the authors’s own words: “t's not necessarily about
what programming language you learn or use. It's about how you approach
problem solving.”
