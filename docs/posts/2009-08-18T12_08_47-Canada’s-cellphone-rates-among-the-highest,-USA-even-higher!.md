Did you think you pay a lot for cellphone coverage? An [article in the Globe
and Mail about cellphone
rates](<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadas-cellphone-
rates-among-highest/article1247843/>) states that while Canada's cellphone
rates are really high compared to other countries, the USA pays even more:

> "In each category, however, services in Canada rated less expensive than
> those in the United States, which ranked most expensive in low and medium
> usage and sixth most expensive in the high-use category." (from [The Globe
> and Mail](<http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadas-cellphone-
> rates-among-highest/article1247843/>))
