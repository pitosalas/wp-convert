# [Microsoft is to Google as Lotus was to Microsoft](None)




This isn't a huge new insight but it's interesting to see **history kind of
repeating itself**.

Sometimes a product is so **locked in** and so entrenched that it looks like
it will never be beat. After all, no one ever got fired for buying IBM right?
And you'd have to be **crazy** to try to build a new spreadsheet to compete
with Excel, because companies large and small have an unbelievable investment
in training, familiarity and documents so that any change is extremely hard
and costly.

It is said, correctly, I think, that such entrenched software products often
get **unseated during a platform switch.** When a dominant technology platform
(e.g. PCs or Windows) is losing it's dominance in favor of a new technology
(e.g. Cloud-based apps) the dominant software company and products are
**vulnerable**.

Did you know that **Lotus Development** had total dominance in spreadsheets on
MS-DOS? And then Microsoft Windows 'came along' (that coming along took
**almost a decade** but still Lotus got caught short.

Lotus kept investing in 1-2-3 - the couldn't not - while Microsoft without the
' **baggage** ' of an installed base could bet on their 'new platform' and
build a great new spreadsheet called Excel. It was a **gamble, and they won.**

Now we might be seeing history repeating itself. In a New [York Times
Article](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/technology/business-
computing/28soft.html>) from a day or three ago:

> "Microsoft’s long-awaited move, analysts say, is a studiously crafted bet,
> including various offerings at different prices. They are not sure whether
> it represents wishful thinking or a workable strategy. Microsoft’s plan is
> to embrace the demand for cloud-based tools for office workers, which
> promise to be less costly for companies than conventional software, and yet
> avoid cannibalizing a business that is its biggest single money-maker." (
> **from** [Microsoft Takes to Cloud to Ward Off
> Competition](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/technology/business-
> computing/28soft.html>))

Wow, that sounds like what I heard around Lotus about 15 years ago.

Imagine this: " _Lotus ' plan is to embrace the demand for Windows-based tools
for office workers,[…] and yet avoid cannibalizing a business that is its
biggest single money-maker"_
