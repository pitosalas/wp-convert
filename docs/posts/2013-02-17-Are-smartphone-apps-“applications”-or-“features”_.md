Andy [Payne wrote an interesting analysis about the future of the "software
industry"](<http://blog.payne.org/2013/02/16/this-is-not-your-fathers-
software-industry/>) or whatever we should call it nowadays (e.g. is Amazon a
software company?)

Not long ago a classic "put down" of a business idea was: "that's not a
business, it's a product", or worse, "that's not a product it's a feature."
Andy asks:

> This enables an explosion of new projects, but with smaller teams and
