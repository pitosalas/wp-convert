Do you agree that prohibiting texting while driving is **contradictory** to
texting as a way to deliver of major emergency messages?

I am all for prohibiting texting while driving. I admit that I rarely text
anyway, but I do use my iPhone while behind the wheel, but never while the
wheels are moving. I will pull over or do it at a red light. Oh yeah, if the
phone rings while I am driving, I do answer itâ€¦ Hmm. Need to rethink that
part.
