>> [Pop!Tech](<http://www.poptech.com/>) is [one of my all time favorite
conferences](</weblogs/archives/000264.html>). So favorite that I bought a
ticket for this year's event way in advance. I have hit an insurmountable
schedule problem and so I have to miss it this year. So, I have a ticket that
I can't use, they won't refund (the X*&!@([#&!@#'s](<mailto:#&!@#'s>)) but I
can transfer. And it is substantially cheaper than what they are charging now
because of when I bought it. If you are interested please contact me directly
by email.
