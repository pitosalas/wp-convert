Suddenly when you [learn about something once](</2008/11/18/ever-hear-of-
teratomas/>), you start seeing it everywhereâ€¦

This is another example of a [Teratoma which I wrote about
recently](</2008/11/18/ever-hear-of-teratomas/>). This story is even weirder.

The secret [Howard Stern](<http://www.howardstern.com/>) in me wants to make a
joke about this along the lines of "even worse than putting your foot in your
MOUTH!" But I would never say that. It would be in such bad taste.
