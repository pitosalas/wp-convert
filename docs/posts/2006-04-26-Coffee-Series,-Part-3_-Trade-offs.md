**Link: [Coffee Series, Part 3: Trade offs](None):** ""

**First** I was an instant coffee guy. Then I got into brewing **whole** pots,
which led to my **wasting** a lot of coffee. Then, my friend
[Charlie](<http://www.championmetrics.com/>) started working at
[Keurig](<http://www.keurig.com/>), and so I got exposed to that machine and
how **wonderful** it was, and one year I got it as a Christmas gift.  We still
use the [Keurig](<http://www.keurig.com/>) a lot, but truth is that we've been
going through about 10 K-Cups per Day! I was starting to **notice** that this
[wasn't a good deal](<http://www.coffeewhiz.com/>). Not to speak of the
[Starbucks](<http://www.starbucks.com/default.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1>) card which
I'd been **reloading** from time to time. So you can see, I've worked myself
up (or down) the **evolutionary tree**. Anyway, when I got interested in
[Espresso](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso>), I visited [Williams-
Sonoma](<http://ww5.williams-sonoma.com/>) several times to look at the
different machines. The brand I had heard the most about was
[Capresso](<http://www.capresso.com/index.html>).  Without even getting into
the **outrageous** price, I was eyeing the [Capresso Impressa F9, F8
](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_super_f9.html>)and so on. All **fully
automatic** , meaning you put whole beans and water in **one end** and
espresso comes out the **other end**. Wonderful. However, being
[Keurig](<http://www.keurig.com/>) fans, we had gotten used to being able to
choose from **cup to cup** whether it was going to be caf, decaf, flavored or
what not.  A **key obstacle** with these fully automatics for me was that you
more or less had to **commit** to one kind of bean. It's **true** that in
addition to the canister of beans there's a chute that bypasses all that and
lets you send in ground coffee of any kind. But that kind of **defeats** the
whole idea and didn't satisfy me. Plus, there was the **outrageous** price. So
I discovered the [Capresso
Ultima](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html>). One way to think of
this is that it's **just like** the fully automatic F9, but **without** the
coffee grinding mechanism. Now that I've used the Ultima a bit it's also clear
that it's a much **simpler** device both mechanically and electronically. And
by the way it's **way way cheaper**.  So in the end what swayed me:

>>

>>   1. Less money

>>   2. Smaller

>>   3. Able to change coffee type on the fly
