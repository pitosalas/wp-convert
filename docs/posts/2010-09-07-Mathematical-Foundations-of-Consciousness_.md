# [Mathematical Foundations of Consciousness?](None)




Say what? I came across this paper; [Mathematical Foundations of
Consciousness](<http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.4339>). I generally love this stuff:
Mathematics and writings on the nature of consciousness. When I saw this paper
the title really intrigued me. Now my math is not strong enough to tackle
anything like PhD level math (in fact my math knowledge beyond under graduate
level is definitely uneven.)

As I said, my math is weak, so I am not appreciating it, but to me this paper
came across as a bunch of fancy mathematics with only peripheral thinking
about consciousness.
