**Link: [Nerdwallet.com is not the site I have been looking for](None):** ""



I've been using mint.com for years now but every month I hate it a little bit
more. It's too big, too slow, and too buggy. But it's solving a problem that I
need solved which is a comprehensive cloud based personal finance tool that
covers banking, investments, credit cards, reporting and analysis. I can't say
that their decline corresponded exactly with when Inuit bought them but… it
didn't help either.

I've wondered why no one is tackling this space. I try them all and they all
are lacking in one key way or another. Here's a [review from the New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/your-money/household-
budgeting/review-apps-to-track-income-and-expenses.html?_r=0>) From those,
I've been test driving BillGuard and it seems to have potential but I am not
ready to switch yet. So when I read about
[NerdWallet](<http://www.nerdwallet.com/about-us>) I thought, based on the
name, that I had another candidate. I had to search their web site high and
low before I could find a summary of what they do:

> We create user-friendly tools, crunch numbers and give you all the results,
> unfiltered. Across banking, credit cards, education, health care, insurance,
> investments, mortgages, shopping and travel, we offer data-driven tools and
> impartial information to help you make solid decisions about the money you
> work hard to earn. In short, we do the homework so you don't have to.

Nope. Keep looking.
