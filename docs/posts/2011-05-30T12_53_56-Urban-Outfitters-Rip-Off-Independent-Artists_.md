This article, "[Anatomy of a Trending Topic: How Twitter & the crafting
community put the smackdown on Urban
Outfitters](<http://www.myaimistrue.com/2011/05/urban-outfitters-ripoff-
trending-topic/>)" is interesting for two reasons:

  1. Photographs that show graphically that Urban Outfitters, in at least one case, seems to have totally ripped off an independent jewelry designer.

  2. A case history of how that accusation spread through a relatively small set of twitter users and tweets and seems to have forced Urban Outfitters to pay attention.

There is lots of stuff on the web about [ripoffs in general - "You thought we
wouldn't notice"](<http://youthoughtwewouldntnotice.com/blog3/>). Also an
interesting comment thread on this page: "[Did Urban Outfitters rip off an
indie designer, yet again?"](<http://www.boingboing.net/2011/05/26/did-urban-
outfitters-1.html>) where you can see a bit of a debate of whether in fact the
original design was truly original.

Things are never as simple as they appearâ€¦
