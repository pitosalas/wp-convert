[Did you know that Curacao is the 7th
favorite](<http://www.kayak.com/h/buzz/flights?code=BOS&rc=c&ac=nude>) place
that travelers from Boston consider when they are looking for nude beaches in
the Caribean? Miami is the first, Aruba the second. This important bulletin
brought to you by Kayak Buzz, a neat web-2.0-kayak-mashup-with-google that I
just came across. You can look at the URL above to see how it's formed. The
**funny thing** is that the nude beach search isn't available unless you
include the **magic** , secret "&ac=nude" clause. You should [check out
Kayak](<http://www.kayak.com/>), it's a **really good travel search** site
that automates what **you know** you are **already doing** - which is to visit
all the other travel sites with the same itinerary to see who has the best
deal at this moment. Technorati Tags:
