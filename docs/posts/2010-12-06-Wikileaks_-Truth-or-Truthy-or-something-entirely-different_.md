**Link: [Wikileaks: Truth or Truthy or something entirely different?](None):** ""

[David Weinberger](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/>) has, as usual, an
interesting take, and some interesting links relevant to our perception and
the defense or offense of Wikileaks. From his post:

> "I here just want to comment on a particular theory of truth that many are
> using to justify Wikileaks. This ideas says that “the truth” is a neutral
> and accurate depiction of how the world is. One is thus always justified in
> stating the truth.
>
> That definition may be true, or it may be true as stipulated, but it’s not
> useful. In fact, it’s the opposite of useful because it misses truth’s
> value. Someone who babbles an endless series of true statements is insane.
> Kierkegaard talked about this as “objective madness.”
>
> He imagines a patient walking home from a stay in an insane asylum trying to
> convince people he’s sane by repeating over and over something true: “The
> world is round. The world is round.” The same ex-patient would be just as
> insane if he varied his list of true things as he strolls down the street:
> “The world is round. Books have weight. Wheels roll. My toenails are
> growing.” (**from** [Truth is Not
> Enough](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2010/12/05/truth-is-not-enough/>))
