**Link: [Analyzing Data 170,000x Faster with Python](https://sidsite.com/posts/python-corrset-optimization/):** "The article, Analyzing Data 180,000x Faster with Rust, first presents some unoptimized Python code, and then shows the process of rewriting and optimizing the code in Rust, resulting in a 180,000x speed-up. The author notes:"

Very nice example of optimizing code, and showing at least one example of how to make a python program ultra fast.
