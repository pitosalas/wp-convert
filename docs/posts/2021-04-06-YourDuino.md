(**Web site except:** We are continuing to update our shipping methods from China. We now have added and changed some of our shipping methods. For USA customers, we have added a US Postal Service shipping option that is low-cost in place of Hong Kong Air. For other regions, we have added ChinaPost Air which offers low-cost shipping. We now have both FedEx Economy and FedEx Priority service to the USA. All of our shipping options include tracking ability now. Please let us know what you think about these shipping changes. Thanks for your business! &nbsp; Terry & Peng)
