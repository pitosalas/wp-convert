an amusing site called [Google
Sightseeing](<http://www.googlesightseeing.com/>) whose sole purpose is to
point out cool/curious/amusing features that people can pick out from the
(amazingly cool) satellite images provided by [Google
Maps](<http://maps.google.com/>).

Inspired by the pictures in today's feed I remembered that [Target
stores](<http://www.target.com/gp/homepage.html/602-6735980-1186251>) have a
cute image on the roofs of their stores, so I went looking and [found this one
right in my own
neighborhood](<http://maps.google.com/maps?q=02474&ll=42.398932,-71.072949&spn=0.005209,0.007033&t=h&hl=en>)!
