Lately, for some crazy reason, I've found myself, multiple times, in Toronto,
Canada, and Willemstad Cura√ßao. My Sprint phone doesn't work in either place.
As luck would have it, my Sprint contract is about to expire and so I am
trying to figure out whether I should change carriers.

If you are in the same boat, here are some very handy links that I came
across:

  * [T-Mobile International Cell Phone Service Information](<http://www.cellularabroad.com/tmobile_intl.html>)
  * [Verizon International Cell Phone Service Information](<http://www.cellularabroad.com/verizon_intl.html>)
  * [Cingular Wireless International Cell Phone Service Information](<http://www.cellularabroad.com/cingular_intl.html>)
  * [Sprint International Cell Phone Service Information](<http://www.cellularabroad.com/sprint_intl.html>)

From reading these, T-Mobile seems to be the right choice for me and where I
live. Do you use T-Mobile? How do you like it?
