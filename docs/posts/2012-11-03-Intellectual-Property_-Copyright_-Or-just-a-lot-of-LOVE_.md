**Link: [Intellectual Property? Copyright? Or just a lot of LOVE?](None):** ""



I was rather proud of the art I designed for a t-shirt this summer. It's cool
but of course it's a direct ripoff, um, no, I mean, it was inspired by a well
known piece. If I show you my design, below:

![JBSlogoonly](https://i0.wp.com/salas.com/wp-

You will immediately see the resemblance. You might say, oh that was on a
postage stamp:

Or you might say, oh, that was a New York City thing. But you would be
remembering wrong:

![I Love New York svg](https://i0.wp.com/salas.com/wp-

Actually, the stamp was based on an design and sculpture by [Robert Indiana.
](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Indiana>) Yes, it was a [sculpture
first:](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_\(sculpture\)>)

But you can see another copy of the same sculpture in New York City. I saw it
just a few days ago:

![LOVE sculpture NY](https://i0.wp.com/salas.com/wp-

Actually I didn't take that picture, because if you see it on foot, there is
always a line of kids waiting to pose for pictures with it.

Anyway, you can see that my idea for a T-Shirt design was clever but hardly
original. I admit to having some guilt about appropriating the design, but
also I have been keenly attuned to see who else and where else folks might
have borrowed the design.

In Chicago, I saw this:

![LI sculp hope 001b](https://i0.wp.com/salas.com/wp-

On TV I saw this:

In a promotional email from the Institute of Contemporary art I saw this:

![GeneralIdea AIDSwallpaper for mc](https://i0.wp.com/salas.com/wp-

So, what do you say? How badly did I infringe the copyright of Robert Indiana?
Will I be asked to take it down (and destroy the 16 one-of-a-kind t-shirts.)
And will I win the case in court, because, "everyone else is copying it"?
