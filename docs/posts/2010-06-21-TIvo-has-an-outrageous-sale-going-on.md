# [TIvo has an outrageous sale going on](None)




Right now, take a look at [Tivo's
Site](<https://www3.tivo.com/store/clearance.do?WT.ac=tivohome_clearancecenter_HD29_content_body>).
They are 'giving away' refurbished Tivos for $30.00. I just bought one the
other day for $50 (they lowered the price again.) They must have a warehouse
full of these. I think the very comprehensive set of cables that come with the
device alone are worth the
$30![](<https://www3.tivo.com/store/clearance.do?WT.ac=tivohome_clearancecenter_HD29_content_body>)
