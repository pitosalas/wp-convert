**Link: [5 Useful jq Commands to Parse JSON on the CLI](https://www.fabian-keller.de/blog/5-useful-jq-commands-parse-json-cli/):** "JSON has become the de facto standard data representation for the web. Itâ€™s lightweight, human-readable (in theory) and supported by all major languages and platforms. However, working on the CLI with JSON is still hard using traditional CLI tooling.
Lucky, there is jq, a command-line JSON processor. jq offers a broad range of operations to transform and manipulate JSON based data structures from the command line. Looking at the documentation however reveals an overwhelmingly huge number of options, functions and things you can do with jq."
