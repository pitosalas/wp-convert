# [I’ll be teaching a course at Brandeis University](None)




**Follow along as I develop the course:**[Brandeis University Web App Dev,
Mobile App Dev and
Incubator](<http://docs.google.com/View?id=ah8kcntpcgb9_29dpdk3thp>)

I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to co-teach 3 courses next year at
[Brandeis University](<http://www.brandeis.edu>). It's something that I have
wanted to do for a long time now and I am looking forward to it. As an
experiment, I thought I would [publish the course notes as I am developing
them](<http://docs.google.com/View?id=ah8kcntpcgb9_29dpdk3thp>) and perhaps
get some feedback, suggestions or even volunteer guest speakers.

Here are the blurbs:

  * **Web Application Development** : _An introduction to web programming that covers the fundamental languages and tools, including HTML/CSS for page layout, javascript/ajax for client-side interaction, and server side programming in Java, Ruby, and SQL. The course will also discuss security, scaling/optimization, and multi-tier architectures._

  * **Mobile Application Development:** _An introduction to the design and analysis of mobile applications that covers the architecture of mobile devices, APIs for graphical user interfaces on mobile devices, location-aware computing, social networking. The course also covers the theory and practice of space and time optimization for these relatively small and slow devices _.__

  * **Incubator** : _An introduction to software engineering for web and mobile applications. This course covers agile programming techniques, rapid prototyping, source control paradigms, effective software documentation, design of effective APIs, software testing and analysis, software licensing, with an introduction to business plans for software entrepreneurs._

I hope you are interested and take a [look at the detailed syllabus and course
notes](<http://docs.google.com/View?id=ah8kcntpcgb9_29dpdk3thp>) and give me
your comments and also volunteer as a speaker (we will be looking for a
different speaker every week.)
