# [Teaching: Group Projects](None)




I've had occasion as you know to [teach a few times at Brandeis
University.](<https://sites.google.com/site/brandeiscosijbs/>) The courses
were in Web Development, Mobile Development and Game Development. A major
component was a Product Incubator where students worked in teams to develop a
product. The organizational and logistical questions as well as the dynamics
around team work were **significant** and **challenging**.

In my mind the **overall benefit** of team student projects are:

  * students must show mastery of the material to do well
  * it is more fun and rewarding for the students
  * team work is a fundamental aspect of whatever they will do in the future
  * the teachers are around to help steer and guide each team as appropriate

So far so good. Now, Students reported that working on the projects in team
was **definitely rewarding** and effective. But certain students also found
them **frustrating** in these ways:

  * how students were divided up into teams
  * variety of levels of knowledge or skill
  * variety in commitment or dedication
  * grading is not perceived as fair because everyone on the team gets the same one

Here's an [article that writes about How to Fix Group
Projects,](<http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/12/how_to_fix_grou.html>)
and suggests ways to make experiential courses like this more effective. It
suggests an **interesting scheme** for forming the teams and also making
grading more individualized.

He concludes, somewhat **depressingly** , saying that he's not going to try
this himself because all he would get is complaints from the students and bad
student reviews.

What do **you** think of this approach?
