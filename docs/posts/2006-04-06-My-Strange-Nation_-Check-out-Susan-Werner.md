of my favorite singer songwriters, [Susan
Werner](<http://www.susanwerner.com/index2.html>), somehow has gotten herself
into a "[patriotic song
contest"](<http://strangenation.cf.huffingtonpost.com/>) on the [Huffington
Post Blog](<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/>). It's a funny song, and Susan
Werner is absolutely awesome! [Check out the
song!](<http://strangenation.cf.huffingtonpost.com/>) Technorati Tags:
