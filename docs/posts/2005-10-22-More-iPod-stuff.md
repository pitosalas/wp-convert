# [More iPod stuff](None)



>>

>> Continuing my [iPod thoughts](</weblogs/archives/000895.php>), today I read
that a [lawsuit has been brought
](<http://www.betanews.com/article/Apple_Sued_Over_Nano_Scratching/1129913472>)against
Apple on the iPod nano screen scratching situation. So **maybe** there really
is something going on. On my (recently dead) iPod, I did have **plenty** of
mild scratching - I **don 't know** if the problem on the nano is any worse.

>>

>> I got to see one of the new **Video iPods** here at Pop!Tech. Another
**very impressive** device from Apple. The screen is larger than you expect
and the picture, watching a sitcom and listening to the audio over the ear
buds, was **remarkable**!

>> (BTW, in case you missed it, [Walt Mossberg himself commented ](</mt/mt-
comments-pitofake.cgi?entry_id=895>)on [my post
](</weblogs/archives/000895.php>)recently about the iPod nano, **clarifying**
that he didn't write about it because of my post. **Duh**.)
