If you are, or ever were, a Billy Joel Fan you will really like this
interview. Fascinating to read what seem to be the reasonably honest thoughts
and feelings of a Rock Star!

> So he doesn't write anymore, not pop songs anyway. Instead he goes about his
> relatively ordinary life in plain sight in a cedar shake house in the middle
> of Sag Harbor village. He has a few of his vintage motorcycles in the
> garage, and his boat slip is within walking distance. He is seemingly never
> alone, spending his time in the company of his two pugs or his live-in
> girlfriend of three years, Alexis Roderick, a former Morgan Stanley risk
> officer (who he probably wishes had been alongside him in the 1970s to
> assess his first record deal). What he lacks in output, he more than makes
> up for in opinions -- about his legacy, his mistakes, a rock-star life lived
> hard and the heroes and villains he met along the way. If the new music of
> many of his contemporaries is any measure, prolificness is an overrated
> quality. Once a pop genius, always a pop genius. We ought to know by now.
