>> Someone whose oppinion I listen to, Karsten Lentzch, recommends these books
about user interface design:

>>

>>   * [Jeff Johnson: GUI Bloopers: Don'ts and Do's for
Designers](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1558605827/qid=1088740910/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-8578301-0353756?v=glance&s=books&n=507846>)

>>   * [Ellen Isaacs: Designing from both sides of the
screen](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672321513/qid=1088741013/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-8578301-0353756?v=glance&s=books>)

>>   * [Mullet: Designing Visual
Interfaces](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0133033899/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_3/102-8578301-0353756>)

>> Background: I went to a couple of presentations by Karsten Lentzch at
JavaOne. He is the author of an impressive Java/Swing user interface library,
called [JGoodies](<http://www.jgoodies.com/>). I've been using his stuff in
[BlogBridge ](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)from almost the very start so it was
good to meet him face to face.

>>

>> In fact it was basically a go-no go question for me on using Java for
BlogBridge: "Can a beautiful user interface be built with Java?" In the end, I
discovered JGoodies and decided that it was possible, and so decided to go
with Java.
