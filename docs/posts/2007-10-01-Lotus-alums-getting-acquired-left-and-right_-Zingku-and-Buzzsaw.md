In recent weeks there have been two exciting announcements of acquisitions of
companies started by friends of mine, and not coincidentally, ex-[Lotus
Development Corporation](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Software>) folks.

Congratulations to **Mussie Shore** , who started Zingku on his
[announcement](<http://www.zingku.com/>) that he's entered into an agreement
to have Google acquire their [Zingku service](<http://www.zingku.com/>).

And congratulations to: **Rick Treitman, Mike Kraley, Paul Kleppner** , and
many others on their [announcement that Adobe Systens has signed a definitive
agreemenet to acquire Virtual Ubiquity](<http://blog.virtub.com/>), makers of
[Buzzword](<http://www.buzzword.com>).

Way to go!!!
