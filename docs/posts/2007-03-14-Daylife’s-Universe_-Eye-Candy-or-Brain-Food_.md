[Daylife](<http://www.daylife.com>) is a new news oriented web site that came
onto the scene a little while back to a lot of fanfare. I've used it on and
off and it's ok. It's certainly a lot prettier to look at than things like
[Google News](<http://news.google.com/nwshp?ned=>). Daylife's emphasis on
design and the use of photography both are quite striking and make the site
worthwhile.

Today they are introducing another wonderful bit, via
[Daylife](<http://www.daylife.com/labs>) Labs (does everyone have to have a
'labs' now?) It's called [Daylife Universe.](<http://universe.daylife.com/>)

What is it? I can't quite explain it. It's a super mega visualization of all
the news that is happening or is happening in a series of displays (they call
them [stages](<http://universe.daylife.com/stages.html>).) It's one of those
things that you have to see, and even then, you have to play with.

There's no question that it's a very interesting and novel product of graphic
design, animation and creativity. [Check it
out.](<http://universe.daylife.com/>)
