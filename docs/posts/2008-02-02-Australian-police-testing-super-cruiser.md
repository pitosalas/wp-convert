> transformation from police cruiser to police destroyer is almost complete.
> Researchers at Australia's National Safety Agency, along with Holden,
> Motorola and the Monash University Accident Research Center, have created an
> Emergency Services Concept Car that is not your standard black-and-white.
>
> They claim the development of the car was necessitated by overheating issues
> in current cruisers and adequate power management. Emergency services
> personnel had so much technology crammed into their vehicles that they
> needed a better way to keep things cool and in control. We guess that once
> they replaced most of the peripherals with one central, voice-activated
> computer, they realized all the other stuff they could stuff inside.
>
> So they added a license-plate reading camera that can process 5,000 to 8,000
> license plates in ten hours. There are three additional cameras to keep
> track of, well, everything. There's a device for police to be able to send
> messages over another vehicle's car stereo. And there's also an item called
> "Starcatch" that fires a GPS dart into a vehicle that the police want to
> follow. It's only a concept vehicle for now, but the Aussie authorities are
> showing interest.
