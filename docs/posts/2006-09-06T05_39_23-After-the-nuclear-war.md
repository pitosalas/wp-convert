>> Here is a little photo-session of an abandoned city. When the Soviet Union
collapsed, government didn't have much funds to support some small cities
around strategically import objects. People of these cities were left all by
themselves. Nobody could support them because any communication with this
places terminated after the army decided that they now don't have money to
support those objects.
