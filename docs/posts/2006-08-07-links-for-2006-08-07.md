  * [AOL Releases Search Logs from 500,000 Users](<http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~dangelo/aol-search-query-logs/>) Very interesting and possibly very worrysome. You'd think that releasing anonymous search results is no big deal (at least I did) but some examples mentioned in this brief article say otherwise (tags: [interesting](<http://del.icio.us/pitosalas/interesting>) [searh](<http://del.icio.us/pitosalas/searh>) [aol](<http://del.icio.us/pitosalas/aol>) [soflow](<http://del.icio.us/pitosalas/soflow>) [privacy](<http://del.icio.us/pitosalas/privacy>))
