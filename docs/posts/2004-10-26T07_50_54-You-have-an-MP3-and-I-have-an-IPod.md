>> You have an MP3 and I have an IPod. I want to listen to that MP3 while
driving, walking, or working out. Anything that will facilitate and make it
more convenient for me to achieve that is **valuable**. **End of story.**

>>

>> Before anyone coined the term **Podcasting** , and before there were
**enclosures** in RSS, this real-life problem existed and was seeking a
solution. **Substitute** any portable player for IPod, **substitute** any
digital media type for MP3, and you can see that this is a **far broader
problem** than is being argued about and discussed.

>>

>> The **technical approach** will not make people want my mp3 any less or
more. And people who don't have a need to consume their digital media while
disconnected from the net won't care. And certainly there may be more
**efficient** approaches for getting the media from here to there
(BitTorrent).

>>

>> But I don't see how anyone can argue **Podcasting** is not a **great step
forward.**
