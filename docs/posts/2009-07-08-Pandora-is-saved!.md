# [Pandora is saved!](None)




[Pandora is one of my favorite music sites](</2009/02/01/subscribe-to-
pandora/>). It's a quick way to get an infinite play list built around a song
that you give it to start with. I've become a fan of several artists that I
heard on [Pandora](<http://www.pandora.com/>) for the first time. I hear that
their catalog of music isn't nearly as large as some other well known music
sites, but I could never tell any lack of grat music. So
[Pandora](<http://www.pandora.com/>) is pretty excellent… except they were in
danger of going under due royalty rates that they were being charged.

[Well here's the good news: "Pandora (And other internet radio) Has Officially
Been Saved!"](<http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/pandora-and-other-
internet-radio-has-officially-been-saved/>)
