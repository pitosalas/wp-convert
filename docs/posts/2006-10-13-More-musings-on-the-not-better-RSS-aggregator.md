**Link: [More musings on the not-better-RSS-aggregator](None):** ""

One **correspondent** **asked** : "Isn't this what bb:library is about or
Technorati Blog Directory or egs. like [Corante Web
Hub](<http://web.corante.com/>), [Global
Voices](<http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/>), [World
Changing](<http://www.worldchanging.com/>)?"

>> "But I imagine this new product/service if it is built, will have in it's
plumbing information like what we have in the library and also an rss
aggregator.

>>

>> But the idea is that this thing will never include the words rss, opml etc.
To give you and idea, some of the names I've played with are:

>

>> feed.tv

>>

>> omnivor.us

>>

>> the daily ME

>>

>> eclecti.ca

>

>> **Why**? Because I imagine this being something that someone who **loves to
keep** up looks at **daily** and finds stuff of interest. Corante Web hub is
kind of like that, but for a few (3 I think) topics. Also they have original
content.

>>

>> This thing is **more like** a tv with 1000 channels that you can pick from
depending on what your interested in.

>>

>> By the way the target for this would be very different than for BlogBridge.
BB is for power feed readers, this thing would be for people that barely know
how to check their email.

>>

>> Am I nuts? **Please stop me** before I go off the deep end again :)"

> By the way, which name speaks to you the most? None of them available
