Did you hear that [Google bought Sparrow?](<http://sparrowmailapp.com>)
Sparrow is a really cool email client that I for one have been using very
happily for a while now.

Did you hear the announcement that [there would be no more development of
sparrow](<http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google-acquires-sparrow-email-
app-a-trojan-horse-for-google.php>)?

Did you hear [that some people were upset at this, while others defended
Sparrow's "right"](<http://www.elezea.com/2012/07/sparrow-google-
acquisition/>) to let themselves be sold? ( **Huh**????)

Anyway, I am **not getting** into that discussion. I was **selfishly sad** ,
because I am very fond of Sparrow and I know (from first hand knowledge, more
than once, but also as a customer) that the product that is acquired **doesn
't often do well in its new home, **and so I need to end my addiction to
Sparrow.

But then came the announcement that Mountain Lion (the new OS X for Mac) was
coming out today. I thought I had a theory: Maybe Mail.app on Mountain Lion
would be **every bit as good as Sparrow.**

****Sparrow, seeing the writing on the wall decided better **not to wait** for
the inevitable, and ran into Google's arms. (After all, I can think of many
worse companies to be acquired by.)

For that and other reasons (like impatience) I bought my Mountain Lion ($20
for all three computers -- **good deal!** ) First impression: Hmm, what's
changed? Second impression, quick let's go look at Mail.app!

**Bad news.** Mail.app is a clunker compared to Sparrow. It's slow to launch
and slow to work with compared to Sparrow. Sparrow works much more nicely with
GMail than Mail.app.

I guess I will **stick with Sparrow,** for now.
