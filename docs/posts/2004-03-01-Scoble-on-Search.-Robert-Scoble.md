**Scoble on Search.** Robert Scoble (of Microsoft fame) [writes about a new
search utility](<http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/02/29.html#a6730>)
called [LookOut](<http://www.lookoutsoft.com/>). Scanning the web site, it
looks pretty cool. The idea of going to Outlook to search the file system,
though, is a little odd to me. I [recently wrote about my
favorite](</2004/02/24.html#a173>) tool in this space,
[X1](<http://www.x1.com/>). Check it out.
