>> And now for something completely different. I was reading this book: "[It's
Alive](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400046416/102-3202368-3881736?v=glance>)"
over the weekend. Particularly of interest to me was all the discussion about
so-called "Agent Based Modeling." Agent based modeling is **a big word** for
simulations used generally to research and understand systems involving many
independent agents.

>> They often have very cool visual displays where you can see, variously the
agents traversing their space, growing, reproducing, exchanging, consuming,
etc. [There are lots and lots of cool examples of
this.](<http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&q=agent+based+modeling>)

>> I thought that there had to be some **framework** that someone developed to
make it 'easier' to create these models, and indeed, I found what looks like a
really good one: [AScape or Agent Scape. Reading about
](<http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/1/5.html>)it reveals that it is open source
and that it has been used in many real projects that you might have heard of.
It looks very cool and useful.
