**Link: [Kamal: hot deployment tool to watch—or a total game changer?—Martian Chronicles, Evil Martians’ team blog](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/mrsk-hot-deployment-tool-or-total-game-changer):** "The SRE pros at Evil Martians attempt an objective analysis of the promises, applications, and potential of Kamal (formerly known as MRSK), plus things to watch out for." 

An excellent review and investigation of the new hotness in cloud deployment, Kamal. Alternative to K8S and k3s, supposedly much simpler.
