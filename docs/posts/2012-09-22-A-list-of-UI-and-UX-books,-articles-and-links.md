# [A list of UI and UX books, articles and links](None)




I created this quick and dirty list of useful resources for some friends who
wanted to dig into the latest thinking on web and mobile user interface
design. I am sure this list is incomplete and quirky but I thought it would be
good to share:

  * I've had great luck with Lynda.com courses. It's only $25 per month, and you can watch as many as you like. Here's one [about CSSS for Developers](<http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/for-developers/52341-2.html>)
  * Here's another [to teach you Photoshop.](<http://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-training-tutorials/279-0.html>) I've actually taken a lot of this one. The author is great.
  * A famous book with basic concepts on [How to create usable web sites and apps.](<http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=dp_ob_title_bk>) It's lessons are universal and timeless. 
  * [Another book by the same author. Probably excellent too.](<http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy--Yourself/dp/0321657292/>)
  * There are tons of blogs and newsletters with interesting UI and UX lessons. This one, [A List Apart](<http://www.alistapart.com/articles/>) is pretty well known and has many practical how to articles.
  * And [SmashingMagazine](<http://www.smashingmagazine.com>)is similarly useful.
  * This site, [Core77](<http://www.core77.com>)often has good inspirations and photos.
