>>> "Are we going to be a player in VoIP? Absolutely. Are we going to be
prepared to disrupt our own business? Absolutely, Why? Because if not,
somebody else will."

>> It reminds me of stuff I used to say way back when, when I was making the
case for building Improv (which was code named "BackBay", and as an R&D
project "Modeler".) In those days, of course, Lotus (remember?) was the
undisputed PC software leader, with 1-2-3 (remember?) being the wunderkind-
unbelievable-cash cow for Lotus. I used to say things like "With Improv we
threw out the rule book and went back to basics - what do people **really
need** to build good spreadsheets?" What happened of course was that **all
that talk** was great and even convincing while we were building the product,
away from the eyes and ears of our field sales force and sales organization.
Once the product was done and needed to be launched and sold, suddenly **we
weren 't quite as easily** prepared to "disrupt our own business." _Live and
learn!_ Technorati Tags: [improv](<http://technorati.com/tag/improv>),
