>> There's cross-platform and then there's _cross-platform._

>> A week later, about 20 testers later, we've done 2 more sub-releases (up to
0.5.2 now) to shake out various platformy problems. It's one thing to get it
to run and another thing to get it to run right.

>> **[Java
WebStart:](<http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/1.2/docs/developersguide.html#website>)No
picnic! ** While the promise is great, it doesn't live up to it. And to think
that this has been a feature of Java for years and years (I think 4) and it
still is full of problems. Still the notion that in one fell swoop we get
intallation and on-the-fly updating is pretty powerful, so we'll just keep on
struggling with it.

>>

>> **Threads aint Threads** One area of Java where cross-platform is not so
cross is in Threads. When it comes to the intricate timing, interaction, and
detailed ordering of things, Threads on Windows can be totally different from
Threads on Linux. The effect? A solid performer on one platform turns into a
deadlock on the other. Fix the bug on the other and the one breaks. Fun.

>>

>> Anyway, live and learn. I am still a believer! I think we can consider the
first early beta up and running, so we are returning to our cave to work on
features. As usual, if you want to be a beta tester, please send email to
beta@blogbridge.com and we'll see if we can fit you in.
