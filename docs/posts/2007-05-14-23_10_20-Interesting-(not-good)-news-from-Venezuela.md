You know that I follow what's going on in Venezuela. Here's an interesting
[article from the Washington Post about the latest
developments:](<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2007/05/13/AR2007051301124.html>)

> "For years defenders of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have harped on what
> they described as the domination of the country's independent media by his
> opponents -- proof, it was said, that Ch?vez was no dictator. Two weeks from
> today that argument will lose all credibility. By then, Radio Caracas
> Television, or RCTV, Venezuela's most popular television network, will
> almost certainly be off the air -- on Chavez's personal order." ( **from**
