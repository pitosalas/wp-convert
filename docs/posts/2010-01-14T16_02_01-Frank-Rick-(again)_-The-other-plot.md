Ok, I am on a [Frank Rich binge, but he does have one thought provoking
article after another. In his column recently he wrote about The Other Plot to
Wreck America:](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/opinion/10rich.html>)

> "If they all skate away yet again by deflecting blame or mouthing pro forma

I just just finished reading the rare business/economics book (I usually skip
them) called [How Markets
Fail](<http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14843529>). A
highly readable and comprehensive review of economic theory as it evolved from
Adam Smith to the present day. From the linked review in the Economist:

> "For Mr Cassidy, the deeper roots of the crisis lie in the enduring appeal
> of an idea: that society is always best served when individuals are left to
> pursue their self-interest in free markets. He calls this “Utopian
> economics”. ( **from** [The
> Economist](<http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14843529>))

I suspect [Mr.
Cassidy](<http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14843529>)
would agree with [Mr.
Rich](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/opinion/10rich.html>), above, and
vice versa.
