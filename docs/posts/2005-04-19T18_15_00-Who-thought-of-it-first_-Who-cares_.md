>> Microsoft and Apple are
[arguing](<http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5675681.html?tag=nl.e589>) about
**who came up first** with the idea of having a pervasive search capability
built into the OS Apple is shipping it **imminently** in Tiger, and Microsoft,
**eventually** , in Longhorn.

>> Well let's see: Windows had a broken Find command in the start menu
forever. Apple has had find in the finder forever. Microsoft was talking about
this kind of pervasive Find capability since Cairo.

>>> "As described by Nash, the Cairo directory will maintain separate stores
for files and the directory, but the file system will be extensible so users
can add attributes, such as who created it, to a file identifier. The
directory will be able to search for objects using those attributes, according
to Nash." (from a [Network World article of
4/8/96](<http://www.nwfusion.com/archive/1996/96-04-08micr-a.html>) - **9
Years ago!** ) **

>> I say, who cares? It is mind boggling that it's taken them **this long** to
actually make it into the OS. Both Apple and Microsoft are **way late**.

>>

>> I also say, the only thing that matters is **shipping** the functionality
to customers, and looking at it that way, clearly **Apple gets props** over
Microsoft.
