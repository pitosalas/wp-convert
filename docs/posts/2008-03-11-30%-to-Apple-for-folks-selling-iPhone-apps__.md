**Update from Pito :** Seems like I jumped the gun a little. Such are the
risks of blogging I guess. If you look at the [comment thread to the post I
referenced](<http://jutopia.tirsen.com/2008/03/07/apple-doesnt-get-it/>) I
would have to say that Apple's position is fairly reasonable. 30% for hosting
apps, credit card processing, and most importantly promotion of my app to
gazillions of iPhone owners. The only remaining beef if any is that (according
to the thread) there is no other way to get a 3d party app onto the iPhone -
you have to do it through Apple.
