Hey, I just came across this:

>>

>>> "The **Invention** of the Pivot Table: The concept that led to today's
pivot table came from the halls of the Lotus Development Corporation with a
revolutionary spreadsheet program called Lotus Improv. Improv was envisioned
in 1986 by **Pito Salas** of the Advanced Technology Group at Lotus.
Realizing that spreadsheets often have patterns of data, Pito concluded that
if one could build a tool that could recognize these patterns, then one could
build enhanced data models. Lotus ran with the concept and started developing
the next-generation spreadsheet." (**from** [Pivot Table
Crunching](<http://safari.oreilly.com/?x=1&mode=section&sortKey=title&sortOrder=asc&view=&xmlid=0789734354/fm01lev1sec3&g=&catid=&s=1&b=1&f=1&t=1&c=1&u=1&r=&o=1&n=1&d=1&p=1&a=0&page=0>))

>>

>> Yes, that's pretty accurate, and it's in an actual book! Neat.
