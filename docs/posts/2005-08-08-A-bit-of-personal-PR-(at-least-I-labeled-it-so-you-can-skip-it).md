>> Hey, I just came across this:

>>

>>> "The **Invention** of the Pivot Table: The concept that led to today's
pivot table came from the halls of the Lotus Development Corporation with a
revolutionary spreadsheet program called Lotus Improv. Improv was envisioned
in 1986 by **Pito Salas** of the Advanced Technology Group at Lotus.

>>>

>>> Realizing that spreadsheets often have patterns of data, Pito concluded
that if one could build a tool that could recognize these patterns, then one
could build enhanced data models. Lotus ran with the concept and started
developing the next-generation spreadsheet." ( **from** [Pivot Table
