Do you receive tons of notification emails form your various subscriptions or
social sites like Twitter and Facebook and the others? Have you thought about
the impact on your productivity all these teasers are?

Well, you might have forgotten (or are you too busy to figure out) how to
manage or shutdown the notifications. Check out this handy toy that I just
came across: [Notification Control.](<http://notificationcontrol.com/>)

And in a related story, here's a similar site if you want to review your
security and permissions settings on all these sites. Another chore often put
off to our own detriment! [My Permissions](<http://mypermissions.org/>).

Yeah there's really very little to these two sites but I think you might find
them very useful!
