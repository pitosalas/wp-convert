>> As you know, [I am quite impressed with Microsoft's ability to build and
ship and deploy and sell and support software at an absolutely mass
scale.](</weblogs/archives/000475.html>)

>>

>> Yet, on my second XP SP2 installation, it **totally destroyed and hosed my
computer**. It took a superhuman effort (with Google and MSDN help) to recover
it.

>>

>> Briefly, here's what happened:

>>

>> The computer being upgraded (a 4 year old Dell running XP with .5 Gig of
Memory and 40 G of Disk) lost connectivity to the server that had the upgrade
pack on it (due to a wire being unplugged - duh.) This aborted the upgrade,
and which caused the upgrade to try to unwind itself.

>>

>> Up to a point when one of those famous " **about to install unsigned
software, do you want to proceed** " messages that [I love so
much](</weblogs/archives/000460.html>) came up, quite unexpectedly. Being
suspicious of what might be going on, I said "no." _Everything seemed fine._

>>

>> Later on, when I tried to reboot, **it failed, hard**.

>>

>> Over and over again, blue screen of death! Booting from floppies didn't
work. Booting from CDs didn't work. Booting to DOS worked, but when I tried to
look at the C: drive it said that it wasn't there.

>>

>> Anyway, **long story short** , after a bit of searching I found that I was
not the only one. [And Microsoft, God Bless em, had a technote
](<http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;875355>)that took
me through a tortured process of cutting 8 floppies, booting of of them into
the "Recovery Console", lighting some incese, and following a bunch of steps.
And yes, I am back up again, **without SP2 installed.**

>>

>> **So I guess this is the exception that proves the rule.**
