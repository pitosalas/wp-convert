Just got to Vancouver for
[OOPSLA](<http://www.oopsla.org/2004/ShowPage.do?id=Home>). Just checked into
my hotel room, and am doing email while [watching
baseball](<http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/gd2004.html?2004_10_24_slnmlb_bosmlb_1>).
Because of the way the room is set up, I am able to watch the game through a
**mirror**.

>> You know what's **weird**? Runners seem to be running from **home** to
**third** to second to **first**. Left field is right field. The world is
upside down! Well actually leftside right.

>> Watching baseball through a mirror. **Funny.**
