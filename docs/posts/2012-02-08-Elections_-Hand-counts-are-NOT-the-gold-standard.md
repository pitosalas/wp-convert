There is always a good deal of **controversy** surrounding elections and in
particular, whether an election is 'fair' or not. As I have been working on a
project with the [Open Source Digital Voting Foundation
](<http://www.osdv.org>)I've been exposed to this from time to time.

This controversy arises in many different guises. There is a group that is
**absolutely against using computers** in any way shape or form to run
elections. Given that we need to count the votes of some 200 Million people in
this country alone, it seems **far fetched** to try to do that without a
computer involved anywhere.

Others say that the act of looking at a ballot and determining the votes cast
should only done by people, working in well organized teams with carefully
designed procedures. They refer to this as the ' **gold standard '** of
counting, the only way to be really sure that we are counting votes correctly.

That is **not** quite as far fetched. But also **not** self evident. Here
comes a study that tries to rigorously measure the error rates of hand counted
ballots. They say:

> '"It is probably impossible to completely eliminate errors in hand counting
> of ballots," Byrne said. "However, there are new auditing methods that
> capitalize on advanced statistical procedures that can help ensure that
> final election results better match what is actually on the ballots. It is
> important that we become aware of the limitations of current methods and
> develop alternative ways to improve the accuracy of election results."' (

> University)](<http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&ID=16725&SnID=1526014862>)

The bottom line result that they found was that "Hand counting of votes in
post election audit or recount procedures can result in error rates of up to 2
percent." You can **easily recall** recent elections that were decided by less
than 2 percent, right?

Bruce Schneier (a highly respected cryptography and security expert) says:

> "All voting systems have nonzero error rates. This doesn't surprise
> technologists, but does surprise the general public. There's a myth out
> there that elections are perfectly accurate, down to the single vote.
> They're not. If the vote is within a few percentage points, they're likely a
> statistical tie. (The problem, of course, is that elections must produce a
> single winner.)" ( **see** [Bruce Schneier's
