They may not like me to say this, but as a longtime subscriber, I've been very
disappointed for the last several seasons at the [Huntington Theater in
Boston](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org>). A very hit or miss program with
only a few memorable plays.

Well I did stick with the [Huntington](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org>) and
it's time for me to say, like, [Randy
Jackson](<http://www.americanidol.com/bio/randy_jackson/>) of American Idol:
"The Huntington Theatre **Is Back** (man)"

This year we've been treated to a series of **memorable, interesting, well
produced** shows. It's been a **pleasure**.

Most recently, and still running are [Becky
Shaw](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6806&src=t>)
and [Stick
Fly](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6815&src=t>).
They are  both excellent shows. They are maybe similar in that they are new
plays, I think they are set more or less in the present, representing
complicated and interesting relationship dilemmas, yet with humor. (Whoops, as
I write that, I wonder, do I like them because that sounds like a TV Show?) I
recommend you see them both though, they are really worth while.

Yes even this season had a couple of **weak plays** : [A Long and Winding
Road](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6812&src=t>)
(boring autobiography by/about/with Maureen McGovern), [A Civil War
Christmas](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6800&src=t>)
(ok, but somewhat hokey Christmas show)

But, on the positive: here are the **great plays of this season** at the
[Huntington](<http://www.americanidol.com/bio/randy_jackson/>):

  * [Becky Shaw](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6806&src=t>) (Relationship drama: two love triangles overlapping and a really awkward double date.)
  * [Stick Fly](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6815&src=t>) (Relationship drama surrounding a young couple who is seeking and not getting the approval of the family)
  * [Fences](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6797&src=t>) (Fiftys father and son story)
  * [All My Sons](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=6803&src=t>) (World War II family story involving fraud and redemption)

Way to go [Huntington](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org>)! I think Becky Shaw
and Stick Fly are still running. Go see them.
