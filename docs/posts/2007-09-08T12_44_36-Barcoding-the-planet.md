"picture-1.png")Semapedia is a quirky project that wants to get us to put
these special little barcodes on everything on the planet.

The idea is that you walk up to something, say the Eiffel Tower, or my house,
point your cell phone camera at it and a click or so later, you get a nice
article on the screen of your phone, describing it.

I first read about it in [Jeremy Wagstaff's 'Loose
Wire'](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118607066711486214.html.html?mod=technology_main_promo_left>
"Jeremy Wagstaff") series.

Quirky, in a Don Quixote kind of way.
