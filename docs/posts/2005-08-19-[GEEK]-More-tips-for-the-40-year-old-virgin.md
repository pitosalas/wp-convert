>> Here's something **funny** I came across: "Sex Tips for Geeks: How to be
Sexy" where we learn such gems as:

>>

>>> "While human beings often have sex for pleasure, the instincts that drive
human mating behavior have been shaped by a deadly serious game of
evolutionary selection.

>>>

>>> Sexually attractive people are those whose characteristics suggest they
are well equipped to help you propagate your genetic line successfully.

>>>

>>> Good looks are sexy because they correlate with health and a robust immune
system; wealth and status are sexy because they signal ability to sink high
levels of investment into offspring, increasing their chances of surviving to
reproduce" ( **from** ["Sex Tips For
Geeks"](<http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/sextips/sexy.html>))
