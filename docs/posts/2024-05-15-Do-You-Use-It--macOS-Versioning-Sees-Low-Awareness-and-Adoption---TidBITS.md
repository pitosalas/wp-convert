**Link: [Do You Use It? macOS Versioning Sees Low Awareness and Adoption - TidBITS](https://tidbits.com/2024/05/13/do-you-use-it-macos-versioning-sees-low-awareness-and-adoption/):** "The results of our poll asking how often you use macOS’s versioning feature show that nearly three-quarters of TidBITS readers either never use versioning or don’t even know what it is. But versioning could save you from losing work—it’s worth trying." 

Versioning? Never knew about this!
