We are thinking of planning a trip to Costa Rica. Part of the trip is to get
from Tabacon to Monteverde, which I gather is a very popular tourist route,
being between two of the most scenic parts of the country.

We are trying to gather information about that drive. Is it realistically 3
hours? Or is it more like 6 hours?

Part of my research uses Google maps, right? Have you seen the Google maps 3D
driving simulation thing? It's amazing!

[Follow this link to the Google Maps ](<http://g.co/maps/qpq4d>)page, and then
locate the 3D button in the white margin on the left next to the directions.
Click the button and BE AMAZED!!
