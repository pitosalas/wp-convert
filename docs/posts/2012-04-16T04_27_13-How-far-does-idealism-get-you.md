[David Brooks of the New York Times, in an article about (my interpretation)
the limits of idealism:](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/opinion/brooks-
sam-spade-at-starbucks.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss>)

My favorite line from "The Maltese Falcon" (from memory, so paraphrased):
"Loose a son, you can always get yourself a new one, but… there's **only one
Maltese Falcon.** "

Anyway, that's off topic.

This article makes the case that if you are not happy with the ways "
**things** " (the world, your town, your company) are run, you can't make
fundamental change other than engaging with " **the system "**.
