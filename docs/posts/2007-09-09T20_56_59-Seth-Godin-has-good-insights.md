Check out [this
post](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/sethsmainblog/~3/153853886/how-
to-spend-20.html>) where Seth Godin gives some really good ideas about how
Apple might have better handled the price change of the iPhone. See it in
[Seth's Blog:](<http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/>)

> -- Free exclusive ringtones, commissioned from Bob Dylan and U2, only
> available to the people who already had a phone. (This is my favorite
> because it announces to your friends-every time the phone rings-that you got
> in early). -- Free pass to get to the head of the line next time a new hot
> product comes out. -- Ability to buy a specially colored iPod, or an iPod
> with limited edition music that no one else can buy. **The key** is to not
> give price protection to early buyers (that's unsustainable as a business
> model) but to make them feel more exclusive, not less.
