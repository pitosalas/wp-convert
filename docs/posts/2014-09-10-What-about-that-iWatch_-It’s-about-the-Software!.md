**Link: [What about that iWatch? It’s about the Software!](None):** ""

I've seen commentary that it's ["disappointingly
familiar"](<https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/509418078523121664?_ga=1.69942866.337543244.1409238690>),
i.e. it looks just like several other computer watches, like the
[Pebble](<http://www.cnet.com/products/pebble-watch/>) or even the [iPod Nano
attached to a strap.](<http://www.bestbuy.com/site/griffin-technology-slap-

Or that it's[ Much Ado About Nothing.

nothing/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Engadget&?ncid=rss_full>)But
I think that commentary **misses the point,** because it _focuses just on the
hardware.  _

It's true that the Apple Watch hardware, at first glance, is kind of boring. I
am really sorry to have to say that because it does seem like [some world
class design went into it](<http://www.apple.com/watch/films/#film-design>),
especially the amazing collection of straps, one more beautiful than the next.
But still, it looks like a little rectangular computer thing on my wrist.
_That 's the hardware._

The software on the other hand is a breakthrough. I haven't played with it but
I sense that it contains one new invention after another and it will set a
whole new standard that others will definitely imitate.

So my prediction: the Apple Watch is like the first iPhone. In retrospect a
little clunky, maybe a little slow, maybe without the battery life you would
like. But it is a foundation on which will set the standard for wearables for
a long time.
