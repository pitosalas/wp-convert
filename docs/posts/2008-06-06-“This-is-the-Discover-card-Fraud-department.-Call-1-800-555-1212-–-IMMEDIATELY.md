Sounds ominous, right? So I call them up, and I hear a serious voice telling
me to please hold on, then I hear the official sounding "you are being
recorded" beep beep beep.

Then the voice comes on the phone and says, "Thanks for calling Discover Card.
Please give me your Discover Card number."

What would you do? I am worried about fraud on my card, right? But do I know
who I am actually talking to?
