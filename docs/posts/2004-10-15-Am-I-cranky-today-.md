Here I go again, picking a out quote from a [blogger who I really like
](<http://scoble.weblogs.com/>)and dissecting it. I don't know, maybe I am
cranky. Robert Scoble, of Microsoft and Scobelizer fame, [reports on a
conversation he had with Kim
Polese](<http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/15.html#a8421>). All in all
a **fascinating** bit, and I hope Kim realized that Scoble was going to blog
the whole dang thing. Buried somewhere in the middle, Scoble says:

>>

>>> "It was not possible until there was **friction free
collaboration**(blogs, RSS, Wikis, IRC chat), and a large number of open
source components."

>>

>> Maybe it's because I come from the world of
[**collaboration**](<http://www.eroom.com>), but I hate seeing people's
fascination and even **infatuation** with theh new stuff that's no better than
the old stuff, or sometimes way worse.

>>

>> [I won't pick on Wiki's again](</weblogs/archives/000463.html>) (although I
still feel the same…), but how about IRC? I mean calling IRC 'friction free'?
Puleeez. I would call it maximum friction! Anyway, just cranky I guess.
