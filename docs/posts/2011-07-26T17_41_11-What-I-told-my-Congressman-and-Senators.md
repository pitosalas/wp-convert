"Dear Congressman,

I implore you to PLEASE do all you can to break the deadlock and the impasse.
I am not saying what proposal I would like you to back. What I want is that
you compromise and get others to compromise so that this thing is solved
TODAY.

It's way passed midnight and the spectacle that we are seeing in DC is
embarrassing and shameful.

There are no good guys anymore. All of you are acting badly. Compromise
already. It takes two to tango, so it's not 'the other guys' it's just us
chickens.

Please I beg you ALL to get along!

Pito Salas"
