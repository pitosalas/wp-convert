>>

>> Have you noticed how man how many new apps that have appeared of late are
available **free of charge**?

>>

>> Web 2.0 services like [gada.be](<http://gada.be/>) or
[flickr](<http://www.flickr.com/>) or [del.icio.us](<http://del.icio.us/>).
And more conventional client apps like
[Firefox](<http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/>)? The list is approximately
infinite. They **come and** go at an amazing rate. And they are all **free**.

>>

>> Not only are they free, **users** seem to _expect_ them to be free. I am
**not sure** how this came to be…

>>

>> Is it a **unintended consequence** of the open source philosophy? Is it a
**incorrect reframing** of the fact that major and well known services like
google and yahoo are ( **apparently** ) free (although ad supported?)

>>

>> Whatever the reason, I worry about the **chilling effect** this can have on
innovation in our industry.

>>

>> **How many** great new innovations have **died on the vine** because there
was just no way for the creators to **pay the rent** while building the **Next
Big Thing**? Even after a year, two years of development, the **prospects**
for getting users to somehow compensate for the value delivered were small to
**none**.

>>

>> Is there **another** explanation?

>>

>> What if this was a pure **supply-demand** invisible hand phenomenon? What
if the **platforms** on which these systems are built (Apache, Tomcat, PHP,
MYSql, Java, and so on) have become so rich and so **powerful** that it has
become _comparatively_ very **cheap** to build wonderful innovative systems
like [Furl](<http://www.furl.net/>), [Rollyo](<http://rollyo.com/index.html>)
or [Reddit](<http://reddit.com/>), and therefore the market was valuing them
correctly at zero dollars. (My friend [Shimon
Rura](<http://frassle.rura.org/Directory/index?feed=1>) put forth a case along
those lines the other day. )

>>

>> While there's an **element of truth** in this second explanation, I believe
it is only a small part of the story. I continue to believe that this tendency
to expect stuff to be free has had a chilling effect on innovation in our
industry.
