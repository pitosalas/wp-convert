Who would think that an august publication like the [Wall Street
Journal](<http://www.wsj.com>) would pull something like this: I was paying
for access to their online edition. I decided to cancel it. Their very rich
and sophisticated web site lets me change just about anything, but there's no
mention, anywhere, including FAQ and help, on canceling.

Oh, and wait, there's more: there is an 1-800 number to call. But guess what,
they too can't cancel. They have to forward you to someone else, and wait
again, who then tries to talk you out of canceling. Geez.
