Interesting article about counting blogs makes a **good point** right off the
bat:

>>

>>> "First, let's step back and consider why we're counting blogs at all. You
no longer see articles that attempt to demonstrate the legitimacy of the Web
by stating how many Web pages there are.  But blogs are still in the process
of entering mainstream consciousness, so numerical credibility is important;
bloggers themselves cite the statistics a lot." (**from** Wall Street Journal
Online)
