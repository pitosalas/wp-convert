A few really quick links:

  * [Responsible Tweeting](<http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&aid=154820>), about the role of Twitter 'news' in influencing real world events.
  * [What to do, by Paul Krugman,](<http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22151>) about how to rescue the world economy
  * About [Robert Rubin's role in the demise or semi-demise of Citicorp](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122791795940965645.html?mod=djemITP&mg=com-wsj>)
  * Our Culture is Better, about a [Dutch politician who released a highly inflammatory film this summer](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122792271890965883.html?mod=djemITP>)
  * And in Take My Position Paper, Please, about how [comics (in the US anyway) have become  more serious and policy oriented](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122791765064865625.html?mod=djem_we#>)

I said 'really quick links'. Elapsed time, 3 minutes. There you have it.
Enjoy.
