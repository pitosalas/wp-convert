I recently saw the movie [Hacking
Democracy](<http://www.hackingdemocracy.com/>). It's absolutely fascinating
and basic background for anyone interested in election reform. In it you learn
about some of the heroes of election reform, including [Harri
Hursti](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harri_Hursti>) who demonstrates in a
pretty dramatic manner some of the weaknesses of commonly used election
technology.

This is from the wikipedia article:

> "Seven participants made out their ballots using the opti-scan paper sheets
> (Hursti remaining outside the test area). Sancho then went to Hursti and
> gave him a ballot which Hursti filled out. Hursti then gave Sancho the
> memory card to insert in to the machine. The operation of the machine was
> explained by Sancho to those in attendance and the card inserted and machine
> turned on which then produced the "zero total tape." The tape produced zero
> votes cast. The test ballots were then inserted in to the Diebold machine
> followed by the "ender card" (same size as ballot) was inserted telling the
> machine to turn off its counting function and start its reporting function.
> The machine then produced a paper tape with 7 yes votes and 1 no vote."

I was curious about the back story and he pointed me to [this paper which goes
into extreme detail of how he discovered the weaknesses and how he was able to
demonstrate them](<http://www.blackboxvoting.org/BBVreport.pdf>). There are
[many](<http://www.votetrustusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=798&Itemid=51>)
[other](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hursti_Hack>) descriptions of what he
did, but this paper, in his own words, is great because of the dry scientific
way in which he describes what was done.
