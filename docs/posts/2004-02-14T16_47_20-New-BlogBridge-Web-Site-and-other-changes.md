>> Happy Valentines Day. As you can see, there is a new web site design. This
one was created by a designer in China. I just thought I wanted something a
little more professional. As for the software, there are several new
developments. We are diving into the questions of unread handling. This is
leading to new designs in several areas: there is now a BlogBridge Preferences
dialog. Included here will be settings allowing Articles to be automatically
set to unread under certain conditions. Also there will be some changes
required in the low level persistence handling to track unread.
