[Andy went to FlexCamp](<http://blog.payne.org/2007/12/08/report-flexcamp-
boston-2007/> "Andy Payne and Flexcamp") last week and was good enough to
[write up his observations. He says:

Yes , but, I think the biggest, biggest deal about Flash and Flex is that some
huge percentage (99%?) of personal computers have a working Flash
installation. This is distinctly different from the Java VM. If you are going
to build a product that needs a cross platform experience and you are deciding
between Java and Flash/Flex, this is a major difference.

From first hand experience this is not true for (see
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com> "Best blog reader for financial
analysts, researchers, investors, fund managers").) True, it seems like Java
is more ubiquitous now on desktops than it was 2 years ago, but it's still not
at the level of Flash/Flex.

Let me plug Java though at the same time:

  * It does deliver on the cross platform graphical user interface promise. 99% of our code in BlogBridge is platform independent - so "write once, run anywhere" is mostly true.

  * The majority of our testing is also platform independent. I would say that 99% of our testing and quality energy is platform agnostic. We do have the occasional windows-only or mac-only bug - often having to do with installation - so the old Java knock - "write once test everywhere" - is funny but not really true.

Finally a couple of other Flash tidbits:

  * Keep an eye out for [Buzzword, a really snazzy word processor](<http://www.buzzword.com>), written in Flash/Flex which might be the current state of the art for web apps written on Flash/Flex.

  * Did you know that [Google's cool street view feature is built on Flash/Flex](<http://www.onflex.org/ted/2007/05/google-maps-street-view-flash-player.php>)? In fact throughout many of your favorite web services (Google, Yahoo, etc. etc) there are snippets of Flex/Flash that are unobtrusively raising the level of user experience on the web.

  * On the other hand, the iPhone still does NOT have flash, and some have [speculated about Apple's strategic and tactical motivations](<http://www.mercurious.com/wordpress/2007/08/29/iphone-and-flash/>).
