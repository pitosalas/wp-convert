* **Web site excerpt:** Excellent article explaining mastodon logic and semantixs, especially with respect to the relationship that instances have to each other and what  moderation options instance operstors have. The author: “I said that Mastodon moderation wouldn't scale, it does. The cultural differences will likely continue to maintain a friendlier atmosphere regardless of size.”
