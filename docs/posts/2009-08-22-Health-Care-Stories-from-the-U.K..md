Sure, one isolated story doesn't prove anything, but then our health care
debate often seems to be carried on the basis of isolated stories, so [here's
an article about the British Health Care
system](<http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/08/22/nhs/index.html?source=rss&aim=/opinion/feature>)
that I came across this morning. From that article:

> > "[…]This, I learned, is what the NHS is about -- common decency. It is
> about the shared belief that all the people who live in the United Kingdom
> constitute a society, and a decent society provides certain necessities for
> its members. Freedom from hunger is one. Police protection is another. Free
> healthcare from the cradle to the grave is simply one more item on this
> list.[…]" ( **from** [Salon, Why I love Britain's health care
> system")](<http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/08/22/nhs/index.html?source=rss&aim=/opinion/feature>)

In a world of a gazillion people it's easy to find a convincing or touching or
outraguous (true) story to argue one side or another of any argument. This is
one more, and it reflects my belief: in a wealthy country, or any country,
**health care is a basic human right** , like shelter and food, it is not a
privilege.
