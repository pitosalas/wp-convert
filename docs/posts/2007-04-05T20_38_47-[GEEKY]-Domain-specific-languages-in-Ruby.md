This is a topic that I've gotten somewhat interested in. If you search for
Ruby Domain Specific Languages in google, you will find a ton of hits. Here
are two that I particularly liked:

  * [Building a DSL in Ruby, Part I](<http://jroller.com/page/rolsen?entry=building_a_dsl_in_ruby>)
  * [Building a DSL in Ruby, Part II](<http://jroller.com/page/rolsen?entry=building_a_dsl_in_ruby1>)
