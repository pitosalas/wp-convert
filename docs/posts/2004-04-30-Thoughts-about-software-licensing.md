>> [Dan Bricklin's written a bit on a topic that's been indirectly on my mind
lately](<http://www.bricklin.com/licensingthinking.htm>). It has to do with
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>), the Blogging tool that I've been
developing as a back room project for a while now (I post periodic updates, so
you might have seen them.)

>>

>> Anyway, the connection is that starting sometime next month when I wrap up
my current consulting project I will be devoting more time on BlogBridge to
see if I can't get it to a real stable and usable form, and who knows, try to
sell it? Progress has been accelerating lately - there's another developer
working on it part time now (Aleksey, in the Ukraine) and things are coming
along nicely.

>>

>> So in my future will be the question of a software license. Right now all
the code is open source and the source in fact is all available free to anyone
on SourceForge.net. I haven't spent a whole lot of time thinking about it, but
I think I can make sense out of having a commercial ("for pay") license of the
running, supported, tested and deployed version of an open source product.

>>

>> Coupled with the fact that BlogBridge will have a service component which
will be hosted on www.blogbridge.com, which opens the door to a subscription
model as well. I think you'll like that when you hear about it 🙂

>>

>> Anyway, I will write more about my plans as they evolve. For now, I just
wanted to point to Dan's interesting pieces.
