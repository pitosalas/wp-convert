Over the last several months I've been following a series of blog postings by
[Jamis Buck ](<http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/>)on the esoteric and quirky topic
of writing programs to design mazes.

For reasons that are not clear, Jamis developed an obsession with mazes and
has collected a series of articles detailing many different algorithms, their
tradeoffs and concepts and writing them up beautifully.

Today in his [final installment he summarized the
project](<http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-
recap>):

> Over the last six weeks I documented eleven different maze generation
> algorithms. It’s been a blast. I’ve had so much fun researching and
> implementing these! It’s been great to see some of you taking my advice and
> applying these to learning a new programming language, as well; I really
> believe there is a lot of value to be had, there. (**from** [Maze
> Generation: Algorithm Recap](<http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-
> generation-algorithm-recap>))

If you like programming, or like algorithms, or want to improve your Ruby
skills, I strongly recommend this series: [Maze Generation: Algorithm
Recap](<http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap>)
