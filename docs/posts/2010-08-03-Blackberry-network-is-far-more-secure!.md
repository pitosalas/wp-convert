**Link: [Blackberry network is far more secure!](None):** ""

I never realized this and I am surprised that BlackBerry and Research In
Motion advertising have not made a big deal out of it. According to this
article [BlackBerry communications travel over a highly encrypted channel, not
the open
internet](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/business/global/02berry.html>):

> "Other smartphones, like the Apple iPhone, are not tied to one e-mail
> service. In general, that means e-mail to and from the devices mostly
> travels over the open Internet and can be relatively easily monitored.
>
> But the BlackBerry uses highly encrypted data that is received by wireless
> carriers’ towers and is immediately routed through a closed, global network
> operated by the company. To enforce the ban, the carriers will stop
> forwarding that data." (from [New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/business/global/02berry.html?_r=1>))
