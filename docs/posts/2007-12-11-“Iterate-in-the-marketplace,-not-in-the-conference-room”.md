Chris Herot tells the [story of
Convoq](<http://herot.typepad.com/cherot/2007/12/convoq-and-zing.html>) (which
then became Zingdom) from the very beginning to the very end. An interesting
chronology, worth reading if you're thinking of (or are currently) playing the
startup game.

> "The company formerly known as Convoq, and later as Zingdom Communications,
> closed its doors Friday, November 30th. It was the end of a five-year run
> that saw three rounds of capital and a comparable number of CEOs and product
> strategies.
>
> While the company was an innovator in on-line meetings, and had a core group
> of enthusiastic customers, it never achieved the traction that would have
> provided the necessary return on capital, and the investors, patient as they
> were, eventually called it quits." (from [Christopher Herot's
> Weblog](<http://herot.typepad.com/cherot/2007/12/convoq-and-zing.html>))

The conclusion is a useful set of lessons learned:

>   * "Iterate in the marketplace, not the conference room. Agile is the only
> way to go.
>
>   * Just because you are using agile methods doesn't mean you don't have to
> plan. Write your stories before you begin an iteration, but don't waste a
> lot of time on the details that aren't needed until later.
>
>   * Don't spend a lot of time and money naming the company until you have
> the product and positioning figured out.
>
>   * If you are depending on paid search to generate traffic then your
> marketing is broken.
>
>   * Raising too much money is almost as dangerous as raising too little - it
> sets high expectations which then drive high expenditures to deliver the
> results on time.
>
>   * If you want to do a consumer-facing product on the East Coast, stay
> engaged with the community in Silicon Valley. By the time you read about
> something in TechCrunch it's too late.
>
>   * Remember the three stages of building a web property: 1. Attract, 2.
> Engage, 3. Monetize. Don't skip a step."
