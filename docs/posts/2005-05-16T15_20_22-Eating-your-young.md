>>> "Are we going to be a player in VoIP? Absolutely. Are we going to be
prepared to disrupt our own business? Absolutely, Why? Because if not,
somebody else will."
([Techdirt](<http://techdirt.com/articles/20050516/0032240_F.shtml>))

>> It reminds me of stuff I used to say way back when, when I was making the
case for building Improv (which was code named "BackBay", and as an R&D
project "Modeler".)

>>

>> In those days, of course, Lotus (remember?) was the undisputed PC software
leader, with 1-2-3 (remember?) being the wunderkind-unbelievable-cash cow for
Lotus. I used to say things like "With Improv we threw out the rule book and
went back to basics - what do people **really need** to build good
spreadsheets?"

>>

>> What happened of course was that **all that talk** was great and even
convincing while we were building the product, away from the eyes and ears of
our field sales force and sales organization.

>>

>> Once the product was done and needed to be launched and sold, suddenly **we
weren 't quite as easily** prepared to "disrupt our own business."

>>

>> _Live and learn!_
