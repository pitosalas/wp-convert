**Link: [Get started with Sinatra | Tutorial | .net magazine](http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/create-do-list-app-sinatra):** "Sinatra applications are often a single file that contain just enough to get the job done. The framework is best suited for smaller web applications, but if a large web app requires an API or web interface for some secondary functionality, then Sinatra is ideal."
