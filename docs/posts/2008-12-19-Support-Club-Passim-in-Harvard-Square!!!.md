Hey! If you live in Boston or Cambridge, and you like music, especially Folk
music, then you've probably been to [Club Passim in
Cambridge](<http://www.clubpassim.org/>) - Harvard Square actually. It's a lot
more than a 'Coffee House' - it's an **institution** where many of your
favorite 70s acts got their start.

Passim is a tiny little folk music club in Harvard Square that's existed years
and years and [where musicians like Joan Baez and Bob Dylan played at the very
beginning](<http://www.clubpassim.org/Page.asp?n=12788&snid=123649884&org=clubpassim.org>)
of their careers. I am friends with various people at Passim, over the year we
have attended lots of shows there.

We have been members for years and more recently even [made some
donations](<http://www.firstgiving.com/pitosalas>) to them. For me, the place
has a wonderful sense of history, not to mention that we are big folk music
fans. Passim has hit hard times over the years on several occasions, and this
year's economic downturn (did you read about it by any chance?) has hit them
hard again.

I know I would hate to see Passim go under or have to curtail it's programs
even more than they are already doing. They have a fairly tiny budget as it
is, and they do a lot for music in the area as well as nation wide.We go often
and it's amazing a place like that lives hand-to-mouth. You wouldn't believe
it.

How about it, **lighten up your 2008** tax return a little and [make a
contribution](<http://www.firstgiving.com/pitosalas>). You will feel happy and
Joan Baez will personally call you to say thanks. **Whoops**. There I go
again. No she won't call you. But I will 🙂
