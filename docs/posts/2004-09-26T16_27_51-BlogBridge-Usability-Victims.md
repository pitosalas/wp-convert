>> We are **looking for a few people** who would be willing to give verbal
feedback on BlogBridge usability. I think it would take at most 1/2 hour of
your time, and you'd have a chance to have a very direct impact on the
direction of the product. Please call Pito or email me at pitoatblogbridge.com
and I will fill you in.

>> When we have **T-Shirts** , you will get one, **gratis**!
