I found this article to be a good primer on what's going on with open
government data. [Remixing Government Data: Through mashups and Web apps,
third parties are making innovative use of agencies'
informationâ€¦](<http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/05/04/Data-democratized.aspx?p=1>)

This is part of the impetus and inspiration for two projects I am working on,
"[Decentralized Data Discovery"](</2009/04/13/geeky-how-datarss-might-work/>)
and "[Government SDK](<http://github.com/pitosalas/govsdk/tree/master>)".
