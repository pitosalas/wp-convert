>> I recently had to buy a new cell phone, and learning how to use it reminded
me again about how **complicated these things are**. How many out there have
not bothered to learn something as simple even as programming in some commonly
called numbers? I know I probably use only 30% of the features.

>> A buddy of mine had the idea that what the cell phone makers should do is
to [design a cell phone specifically for the
elderly](<http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1750&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=zdblog>).What
would it look like? Probably **exactly** like the phone they use at home. [Big
buttons and hardly any
functions](<http://www.engadget.com/entry/8165163305116838/>).

>>

>> While we are **modifying** cell phones, who is going to be the first build
a pedometer into a cell phone. Perfect for **[aging baby
boomers](<http://www.aginghipsters.com/>)** suddenly worrying about their
health!
