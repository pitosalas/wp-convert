Well it's over and I am getting ready to head back to real life. Pop!Tech
remains my favorite conference (and not just because I can drive here from my
house.) It's hard to capture what it's like but if you are interested, here
are some links that could give you a flavor. Thanks to all the diligent
bloggers ([most especially Ethan
Zuckerman](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/>)) who did all this writing so
I didn't have to!
