# [New Jersey election fraud? Or coverup? Or just human error?](None)




[Andrew Appel ](<http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/>)is one of the best known
academics studying and commenting on elections and computer science and
technology related to elections. He wrote a really interesting report, "[New
Jersey Elections Coverup](<http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/voting/nj-
election-cover-up.pdf>)", going into great detail about a specific incident
during the June 2011 New Jersey primary election where the reported outcome of
a particular race was demonstrated to be incorrect.

It was a small election and so they could literally get affidavits from voters
to prove this. Mr. Apple was hired as an expert (apparently he does a lot of
this, which _for me_ colors his words to some extent) to help investigate what
might have happened. [The report tells a compelling story.

If you are one of those who wonders whether election fraud happens or can
easily happen, this report will interest you. It also adds weight to the
conventional wisdom among security and computer experts a physical paper
ballot, marked by the voter, and scanned by a computer is really the best and
perhaps only way to ensure fair elections.
