As you can imagine I've been reading and learning more about security with my
work in Elections (http://www.trustthevote.org). It's a hall of mirrors and I
struggle to really grasp when a possible threat is worse than the cure for it
-- in real world terms, rather than theoretical terms.This article is
perceptive and deep and easy to understand at the surface, but hard to
understand profoundly: [The Effect of Snakeoil
Security](<http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20100904/the-effect-of-snakeoil-
security/>) from [ha.ckers.org web application security
lab](<http://ha.ckers.org/blog/feed/>):
