Jaron [is a brilliant thinker (and an amazing piano player as well) Anything
he writes is interesting. In
this](<http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge183.html>) case he seems to
be **worrying** about how much credence is being given to knowledge in
Wikipedia and related types of sites. I **don 't know** if I agree with him,
but it is a [great
read](<http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge183.html>)!

>>> Jaron worries about: "the way the Wikipedia has come to be regarded and
used; how it's been **elevated** to such importance so quickly. And that is
part of the larger pattern of the appeal of a new **online collectivism** that
is nothing less than a resurgence of the idea that the collective is all-wise,
that it is desirable to have influence concentrated in a **bottleneck** that
can channel the collective with the most verity and force. This is different
from representative democracy, or meritocracy. This idea has had dreadful
consequences when thrust upon us from the extreme Right or the extreme Left in
various historical periods. The fact that it's now being re-introduced today
by prominent technologists and futurists, people who in many cases I know and
like, doesn't make it any less dangerous" (**from**
