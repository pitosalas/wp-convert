I've seen [some discussion
](<http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/05/16/Freedom-0-1-x2148>)on [the
issues related to changing ](<http://postneo.com/2004/05/15.html#a3411>)blog
infrastructure from one system to another. In my case, I moved from Radio to
Movable Type.

>> **My experience** is that is was pretty easy to move the data (no data lock
in) but the problem was the urls. Even if you take steps to make sure that the
root url doesn't change, the individual post and archive urls will probably
change which means that anyone linked to your blog before will stay linked to
your old blog and so you will experience a disruption in your traffic.
