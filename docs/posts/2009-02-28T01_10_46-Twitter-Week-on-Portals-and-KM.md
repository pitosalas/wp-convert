Bill Ives has been running "twitter week" this week on his blog [Portals and
KM](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/index.rdf>). Here something
from his concluding post: [Concluding Twitter Week: Predictions on How Twitter
Will Change Blogs in
2009](<http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/WGHl/~3/vU86ZD7r_Jw/predictions-
on-how-twitter-will-change-blogs-in-2009.html>). It has some very interesting
items about the influence of twitter on blog design:

> "To conclude Twitter week on Portals and KM, I want to share 10 Ways Twitter
> Will Change Blog Design in 2009 by Rachel Cunliffe on Mashable. I am
> reorganizing her content to reflect its availability and then providing my
> thoughts in most cases." ( **from** [Portals and
