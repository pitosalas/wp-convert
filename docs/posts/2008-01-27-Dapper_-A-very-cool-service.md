It's a little hard to explain and I didn't manage to get it working myself
yet, but still I am highly intrigued with [Dapper](<http://www.dapper.net>
"dapper is very cool"). [Dapper](<http://www.dapper.net> "dapper is very
cool")'s tag line is:

> "Get more traffic to your site. Easily provide new means for people to
> access your content (such as RSS). You can use Dapper to create feeds,
> widgets, and APIs with your content and links."

It's a elegant and fancy screenscraping service, as far as I can tell. I think
there may be a lot more to it and I intend to spend the time to learn all
about it.

Here's a really [excellent screencast showing how Dapper
works.](<http://www.readwriteweb.com/images/dapperrww.swf> "dapper cool")
