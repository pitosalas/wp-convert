People wring their hands about the possibility of having Bill Clinton back in
the white house as the first ever First Spouse, working mano-a-mano with
Hillary. I like Bill Clinton a lot - I did when he was president and I still
do. Yet I can understand the misgivings.

"Clinton Obama Hillary Bill")

But the section about Dick Cheney brought an even crazier scenario to mind.

What if Hillary is elected and picks Bill as ……………. VICE PRESIDENT?
