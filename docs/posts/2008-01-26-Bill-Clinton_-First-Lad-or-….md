People wring their hands about the possibility of having Bill Clinton back in
the white house as the first ever First Spouse, working mano-a-mano with
Hillary. I like Bill Clinton a lot - I did when he was president and I still
do. Yet I can understand the misgivings.

But the section about Dick Cheney brought an even crazier scenario to mind.

What if Hillary is elected and picks Bill as ……………. VICE PRESIDENT?
