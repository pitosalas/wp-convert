>> On her site, [World On Fire, Sarah McLachlan
](<http://www.worldonfire.ca/>)has an interesting video, which reminded me
what Video podcasting or Video blogging can become.

>>

>> [Picking up on a theme of mine ](</weblogs/archives/000535.html>)from a few
days ago, one of the important characteristics of the blogging phenomenon is
that people who otherwise would have no access to broadcasting are able to get
their content (text, pictures, audio and video) delivered to interested
people.

>>

>> This perspective says that the **barriers** to creating the content are low
enough now (typing, digital cameras, recorders, video cams etc.) that once the
distribution (broadcasting) barriers go away a lot of people who have
something to say/show are able to do it on their own. **Podcasting**
represents a major lowering of the distribution barriers.

>>

>> The **connection** with this video? She made this Video on a total
shoestring, like a Podcaster would. it's the kind of video I'd expect to see
video podcasted.

>>

>> And another thing: the video and the story about why she made it is pretty
cool too!
