An interesting article about how to think about [designing Artificial
Intelligence for playing
poker](<http://gamecareerguide.com/features/896/poker_ai_a_starting_.php>).
It's high level but gives you a good feel about how this writer went about the
design. You also learn the basics of Poker at the same time:

> "It is very important in this type of project, for any AI project really, to
> fully understand the rules of the game and the tactics typically used to
> win. So when I worked on poker I spent a fair amount of time reading the
> best books and playing the game, both against existing AI and real humans of
> various levels of experience." ( **from** [Poker AI: A Starting
> Point](<http://gamecareerguide.com/features/896/poker_ai_a_starting_.php>))

And here's a follow up article on the same topic: "[Aces High: Numerical
