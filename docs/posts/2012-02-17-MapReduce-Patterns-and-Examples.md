Great review article:

> "In this article I digested a number of MapReduce patterns and algorithms to
> give a systematic view of the different techniques that can be found in the
> web or scientific articles. Several practical case studies are also
> provided. All descriptions and code snippets use the standard Hadoopâs
> MapReduce model with Mappers, Reduces, Combiners, Partitioners, and sorting.
> This framework is depicted in the figure below." (**from** [Highly
> Scalable)](<http://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/mapreduce-
> patterns/>)

**Worth reading** if you are interested in how Hadoop and friends might apply
to the problems that you are trying to solve: "[MapReduce Patterns,
Algorithms, and Use
Cases"](<http://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/mapreduce-patterns/>)
