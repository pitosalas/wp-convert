This is kind of depressing, but I don't know why - but NASA administrator
Bolden says that NASA has no plans to lead another mission to the moon within
our lifetime:

Yes I am old enough that I can remember the Apollo program, and vaguely the
Gemini and Mercury projects. Certainly during my teen age years I followed all
developments at NASA in great detail. I can remember the launch of Apollo 11
(9:32am in July 16 1969) and building models of each of the spacecraft, the
rockets, the landers and so on. I love that stuff. So, bummer.
