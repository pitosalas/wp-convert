A seminal article about an [advanced topic in software testing: Mocks aren't
Subs](<http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html>)

> "The term 'Mock Objects' has become a popular one to describe special case
> objects that mimic real objects for testing. Most language environments now
> have frameworks that make it easy to create mock objects. What's often not
> realized, however, is that mock objects are but one form of special case
> test object, one that enables a different style of testing. In this article
> I'll explain how mock objects work, how they encourage testing based on
> behavior verification, and how the community around them uses them to
> develop a different style of testing." ( **from** [Mocks aren't Subs by
> Martin Fowler](<http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html>))
