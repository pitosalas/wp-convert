I saw this bit today: "[Apple: Will Steve Balmer Show Up At The WWDC
Keynote?".](<http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2010/05/26/apple-will-
steve-ballmer-show-up-at-the-wwdc-keynote/>) Interestingâ€¦ It leads me to
speculate in a different direction.

What if Google is distancing itself from Apple over competition between
Android and iPhone? And so, what if in anticipation of this, Apple, knowing
that it couldn't ALSO be in the business of creating a world class mapping
service, decides to move native support of the iPhone mapping app from Google
Maps to Microsoft Maps? Good theory?


[MSFT and APPL](None)
