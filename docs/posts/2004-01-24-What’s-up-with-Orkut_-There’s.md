**What 's up with [Orkut](<http://www.orkut.com/terms.html>)? **There's this
new ["online community that connects people through a network of trusted
friends"](<http://www.orkut.com/>) that's causing quite a bit of comment here
and there, in blogs and other newsgroups. After all the badmouthing that I've

interest.

**What a clever marketing scheme,**exclusivity,** has built up quite a lot of
attention. Anyone who knows a two year old knows that there's no better way to
generate interest than in denying access! Their other secret ingredient is
that apparently they have [been acquired or backed by
Google](<http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/01/23/HNorkut_1.html>), which is
always a way to get attention.
