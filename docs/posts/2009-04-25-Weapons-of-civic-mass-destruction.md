**Link: [Weapons of civic mass destruction](None):** ""

I am struck by how broken our political process is. I'm not the first nor the
last to make this observation, How did we get here and what are the underlying
reasons?

Here's one way I have started to look at it: we have perfected the science of
persuasion to such a point that it is **now destroying us**. Here's what I
mean:

In the world of CNN and YouTube, all questions, answers, comments and remarks
are all very carefully honed with an eye towards what it would look like out
of context, or as a soundbite in a commercial.

Each candidate has top notch advisers and trainers, the best in the business.
They are like world class athletes at the olympics. Every move is rehearsed
and practiced to perfection. No mistakes are allowed.

They make sure that whenever they open their mouths whatever comes out is
what's most effective (statistically, scientifically, whatever) to persuade.

To persuade who? Of what? That too is science. Who **exactly** ,
demographically, sociographically, are the **folks who need to be convinced**
so that I win? **What** do they have to be convinced of?

The effect of all this is that every word we hear spoken by the candidates is
programmed. **Programmed to have certain effects on the electorate**. We
**aren 't hearing the real person**, their real beliefs or ideas, in either
case.

Anyway that's **my interpretation** of why campaigns and **political speech
has devolved** as much as it has, and why we all shake our heads in amazement
at what passes for political discourse.

We have **created and perfected** this **weapon** which I think of as the
science of persuation and we are watching two parties engaged in what amounts
to **mutually assured destruction** ("MAD").
