**Behavior Signature Analysis (Demo Series 10)** This is a little arcane but I
thought it was an interesting pattern among several products launched at Demo
2004. "Behavior Signature Analysis" is the idea of learning something about
the intent or higher level purpose of an activity by doing pattern analysis on
some aspect of it's low level behavior. There were several companies showing
products that tried to do this at the Method invocation and HTTP Request
levels: that you can tell something about _meaning_ strictly by analyzing
patterns of low level.

>> [**Memento:** BC Krishna](<http://www.memento-inc.com/>) has built a really
cool new solution to measure and understand the actual use of business
application in the enterprise to demonstrate the value of the IT investment.
So in contrast with Imperva, Memento uses patterns of object invocations as
evidence that an application is being used in an expected fashion and using
that information as evidence of business value.

>> [**Imperva** SecureSphere](<http://www.imperva.com/products/securesphere/>)
does this by watching HTTP requests before they are handled by the web server
or database and judging that repeated requests during a single session that
donâ€™t follow patterns (signatures) that were recorded during a training phase
are probably indicators of some kind of malicious activity.
