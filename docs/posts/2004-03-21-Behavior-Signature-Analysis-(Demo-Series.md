>> **Behavior Signature Analysis (Demo Series 10)** This is a little arcane
but I thought it was an interesting pattern among several products launched at
Demo 2004. "Behavior Signature Analysis" is the idea of learning something
about the intent or higher level purpose of an activity by doing pattern
analysis on some aspect of it's low level behavior. There were several
companies showing products that tried to do this at the Method invocation and
HTTP Request levels: that you can tell something about _meaning_ strictly by
analyzing patterns of low level.

>> [ **Memento:** BC Krishna](<http://www.memento-inc.com/>) has built a
really cool new solution to measure and understand the actual use of business
application in the enterprise to demonstrate the value of the IT investment.
So in contrast with Imperva, Memento uses patterns of object invocations as
evidence that an application is being used in an expected fashion and using
that information as evidence of business value.

SecureSphere](<http://www.imperva.com/products/securesphere/>) does this by
watching HTTP requests before they are handled by the web server or database
and judging that repeated requests during a single session that don’t follow
patterns (signatures) that were recorded during a training phase are probably
indicators of some kind of malicious activity.
