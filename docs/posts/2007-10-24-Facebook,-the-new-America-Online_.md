# [Facebook, the new America Online?](None)




[Doc Searls has a new post about
Facebook](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2007/10/23/too-much-facebook-
time/>) which I came across in [ Scoble's Link
Blog.](<http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/14480565058256660224/state/com.google/>)
It mentions something that I've been thinking about too.

Is [[tag]Facebook[/tag]](<http://brandeis.facebook.com/home.php?> "Facebook")
the new [[tag]America Online[/tag]](<http://www.aol.com/>)? Here's what I
mean: Back in the bad old days, there were services like AOL,
[tag]Compuserve[/tag] which were very popular. I was a committed user.

Built-in information sources, built-in instant messaging, built-in ecommerce,
built-in email, built-in search, single signon. **Life was good**. Nothing new
to learn.

But of course we all use the web today which has **disaggregated** all these,
taking advantage of open protocols and formats like HTTP, HTML, and so on. Now
I can (and do) use Email from Google, Search from Google (hmm..) and oh yes,
eCommerce from Amazon, Craig's List, Ebay, and on, and on and on. I can pick
and **choose** and am not stuck with what AOL or Compuserve decides I need.

Over time AOL incorporated mini-versions of popular web sites to stem the
tide. You could order books for example, from Amazon **or** Barnes and Noble
(not sure which) but not both. Maybe you plan travel either with Expedia or
Travelocity, but not both. Depends on who was able to make a deal with AOL.

We are seeing the **exact same** pattern develop in Facebook. Facebook has an
API which AOL didn't have. But it's Facebook's API, not a web API, and that
makes all the difference.

Think about what happens when MySpace and every other social network also has
an API. And what happens when [Google gets into the social graph
business](<http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/21/google-to-out-open-facebook-
on-november-5/>)?

Here's Doc Searls take on it and what got me thinking:
