A couple of New York Times articles today that point out (what others have
pointed out too) that the roots of the disaster in the Gulf have a lot in
common with those of the Economic meltdown last year:

> "AS the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico follows on the heels of the
> financial crisis, we can discern a toxic recipe for catastrophe. The
> ingredients include risks that are erroneously thought to be vanishingly
> small, complex technology that isn’t fully grasped by either top management
> or regulators, and tricky relationships among companies that are not sure
> how much they can count on their partners." (**from** : [Recipes for Ruin,
> in the Gulf or on Wall
> Street](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/business/13view.html?ref=business>))

How true, the similarities are striking. The world is so much more complicated
and out of control than we would like to think:

> "In the weeks since the rig explosion, parallels between that disaster and
> the proto-Modernist one imagined by Melville more than a century and a half
> ago have sometimes been striking — and painfully illuminating as the spill
> becomes a daily reminder of the limitations, even now, of man’s ability to
> harness nature for his needs." (**from** [The Ahab
> Parallax)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/weekinreview/13kennedy.html?ref=weekinreview>)
