We've had it for years and it works like a champ. Only thing is, the toner is
really pricey. So pricey that I started suspecting that something was awry, so
I kept a log of when I replaced what **consumable** and how much I paid. It's
a lot!

>> Yes, " **consumable** ", because in addition to the toner there are a bunch
of other things that 'wear' out and that you have to replace. The printer very
**helpfully** says, "Replace Oil Roller" and **stops** working. **What** the
heck is an oil roller? I don't know but it costs **$40** or so. It is actually
**quite cool** how they have designed the inside of the thing to make each
part **easily replaceable** with nice color coded numbered levers and knobs.

>> But anyway, this does seem to be the **ultimate expression** of the
**razor-blade/razor business**. The printers are surprisingly reasonable to
buy and then, **expensive** to operate.

>>

>> For several years now I've been printing "two pages per sheet" on my color
laser printer, hoping to **save a few bucks**. No not on paper, but on the
'consumables.'

>>

>> **Paper is cheap**. Does anyone out there **know** whether two pages per
sheet **reduces** the consumption of consumables? **Intuitively** , it seems
like it must, but I've never actually been able to **prove** or verify this.
