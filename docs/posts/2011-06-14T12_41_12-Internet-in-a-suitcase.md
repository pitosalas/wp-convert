The [U.S. government is helping create parallel internets
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html>)and cell phone
networks in countries where the government is suppressing free communications
between their citizens. The idea makes sense and is, "pretty cool":

"The effort includes secretive projects to create independent cellphone
networks inside foreign countries, as well as one operation out of a spy novel
in a fifth-floor shop on L Street in Washington, where a group of young
entrepreneurs who look as if they could be in a garage band are fitting
deceptively innocent-looking hardware into a prototype “Internet in a
suitcase.” ( **from** [The New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html>))
