This is a perenial debate with lots of sides. Here' s just some fodder for
those of you who are pondering the question: I guess right off the bat I would
**exclude Java** for a browser based application. Why? Unfortunately it
requires a so-called JVM which may or may not be present. **AJAX** on the
other hand requires a 'modern' web browser, which I think in this day and age
(FireFox) is a **pretty safe bet**. And **Flash** requires the Flash runtime,
which again, in this day and age, is also a **pretty safe bet. ** **Exhibit
#1** : [Check out Zimbra](<http://www.zimbra.com/index.html>), which, if you
believe the web site is built with AJAX. Very impressive. All I was able to
see was the Flash demo (**ironic** isn't it?) but it's quite nice. Technorati
