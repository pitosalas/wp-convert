This is one of those handy dandy [tips that you wish were not
hidden](<http://homepage.mac.com/butlers/iPhotoExtractor/rebuild.htm>), buried
and kept secret: "Hold down the option and control keys while launching iPhoto
and you will be treated to a very nice set of options for trying to recover
your photos that have mysteriously disappeared." I write this to save the next
person a few hours of blind allies. Technorati Tags:
