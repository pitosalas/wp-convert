I just updated this site a little to have some more up to date information
about my consulting business. Yes, you know about this blog, and you know
about BlogBridge, but perhaps if you ever clicked on the links on the right of
this you will have noticed that they were old and decrepit. Well, they are new
and much nicer now. Still nothing profound, but at least informative if you
are looking for me to do work for you!
