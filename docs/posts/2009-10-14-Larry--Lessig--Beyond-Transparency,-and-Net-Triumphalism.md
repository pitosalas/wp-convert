As David W. says, there's a lot that's been written in response to the
provocative article by Larry Lessig. I haven't yet read all of it, but what
I've seen is very provocative (in a good sense.)All the pointers you might
need can be found here: [Larry Lessig: Beyond Transparency, and Net
Triumphalism](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2009/10/13/larry-lessig-beyond-
transparency-and-net-triumphalism/>) from [Joho the
Blog](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/feed/>):

> "Plenty is being written already trying to parse, understand, and come to
> terms with Larry Lessig’s article “Against Transparency” in the New
> Republic. Ethan Zuckerman does his usual outstanding job in clarifying ideas
> sympathetically. Transparency advocate Carl Malamud responds to Lessig. I
> presented my own “walkthrough” of the article. The New Republic has run Tim
> Wu’s response, which agrees with Lessig in important ways. The New Republic
> has also run four other responses, including an excellent response from
> Ellen Miller and Michael Klein, founders of the Sunlight Foundation, the
> leading advocate for transparency. (My response is included in that set of
> four.) Aaron Swartz prefigured Larry’s argument in a piece he posted in
> April: “Transparency is bunk.” Plenty to chew on." (**from:**[Larry Lessig:
