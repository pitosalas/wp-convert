I guess it's the time of year, but I came across [this site for Baseball
umpires](<http://www.macroweb.com/ibrules/>) which is a fun entertainment if
you are into the esoterica of Baseball.  For the more obvious (**seemingly**)
questions that still stump me, Wikipedia is a good resource. For example, do
you think you know what a **[balk](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balk>)** is?
Or what a **[cutter](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_%28baseball%29>)**
is? Technorati Tags: [baseball](<http://www.technorati.com/tag/baseball>)
