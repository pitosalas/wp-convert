>> **RSS/Atom: An idea whose time has come.**[Dave
Winer](<http://archive.scripting.com/2004/03/09#rssIsRaging>) is [reaching
out](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/crimson1/2004/03/08#a1243>) to the Atom
people to try for the grand unification of the two formats. If you look back
at the history of how Atom came to be, and the public record of the debates,
disagreements, potshots that have come before you see that this is a
**couragous step** for Dave to be taking. It's a first step which **we all
hope** will lead to something great.

>> People should read what was written closely: particularly that this is not
meant to be a final proposal but an opening set of ideas on how the
unification might be accomplished (e.g. _" And before stating the offer, let
me say that I am open to counter-offers.")_

>> It is important that we articulate the approach to the unification in a way
that objectively respects and recognizes the value that both Atom and RSS are
bringing to the table. I have no doubt that this will be a difficult effort
requiring give on all sides, but it will set us back on a path where
**duplication of effort** will be replaced by forward progress. It's worth it.
