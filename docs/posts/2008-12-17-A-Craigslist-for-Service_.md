Something I've been thinking about a lot lately is the need for some kind of
platform to match local community projects with resources to do them. For
example the project might be to build a playground, clear a lot, raise money
for the school. And resources might be sources of money, people and things
who'd like a way to contribute to their community.Seems to me that there's a
spot for kind of a .org to create and operate a system like that and offer it
for free or very cheap, locally, then nationally and globally. One thing I've
been working on is to see whether this need is real, and what exists out there
to address it.0Check out this post [A Craigslist for
Service](<http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/12/15/a-craigslist-for-
service/>):
