This [article is somewhat
mathematical](<http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant>) but I
am sure it still hugely simplifies the logic that led us astray. If you are a
pop-math-head like me you will find it interesting:

> than ever before. With his brilliant spark of mathematical legerdemain, Li
> made it possible for traders to sell vast quantities of new securities,
> expanding financial markets to unimaginable levels." (from [Recipe for
