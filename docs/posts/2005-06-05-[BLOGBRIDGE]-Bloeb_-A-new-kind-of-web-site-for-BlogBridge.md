>>

>> We've been experimenting with a **switcharoo** of the BlogBridge web site -
a major overhaul conceived and prototyped by
[Francois](<http://www.emergencemarketing.com/>). (Thanks!) The new site will
be going to production tomorrow, but you get to [take a look
while](<http://www.blogbridge.com>) we are putting the finishing touches on
it.

>>

>> What kind of a **switcharoo**? Well, instead of a conventional site that
happened to contain a blog, we jokingly call this a ' **bloeb** ' (blog+web)
site.

>>

>> You've seen web sites with blogs in them, and you've seen blogs with non
blog content attached to them, right? Well here we have a **full hybrid** ,
with a traditional navigation tree on the left and a bloggish navigation tree
on the right. Our FAQs are blog postings. Our announcements are blog postings.
In fact it's hard to tell where the blog starts and the site begins.

>> Update: **The new site is up. So far so great!
