I'd be the last one to wade into commentary on religious topics, so I just
[share this link](<http://joshyuter.com/2011/12/06/judaism/the-selective-
sanctimony-of-orthodox-judaism/>) because for me it was interesting reading:

> "For those who are committed to being a shomer Torah, I leave you with the
> following thought. If women rabbis or omitting a blessing are greater
> threats to Orthodox Judaism, and thus more worthy of collective outrage than
> are theft, violence, corruption, and abuse, then perhaps the Orthodox
> society has outlived its halakhic usefulness." (from [The Selective
> Sanctimony of Orthodox
> Judaism)](<http://joshyuter.com/2011/12/06/judaism/the-selective-sanctimony-
> of-orthodox-judaism/>)
