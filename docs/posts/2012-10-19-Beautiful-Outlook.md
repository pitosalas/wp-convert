I don't know why this **has not gotten more press.** You should take a look at
Microsoft's new Gmail killer, [outlook.com](<http://www.outlook.com>). It's a
totally web based email client, like Gmail, but the user experience is **miles
and miles better** than Gmail.

Now I am a **huge Gmail user,** and generally I get along really well with it.
It has years of my emails and I have fully mastered its tricks and hacks. It
**works** , it's reliable and it's free.

But boy, as a user interface, isn't Gmail **UGLY**?

And now look at Microsoft's [Outlook.com](<http://www.outlook.com>). I didn't
even realize that such **great, responsive** UI could be built in html. It
might still be missing some features, and maybe MSFT will clutter it up when
they add them, but for now, it is **impressive**.

By the way, the world of Outlook.com is new enough that the good email
addresses might still be available, so get your company@outlook.com **while
you still can!**
