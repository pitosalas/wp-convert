>> Can someone explain why my referrer log for this site is full of spamish-
looking like urls, none of which actually have a link to it? For example:

>>

>> texasholdemcenteral.com, www.freewebs.com, skate.cyberfreehost.com,
google.co.uk/search, www.myspace.com/nyjeter2ox, images.google.ca/imgres,
images.google.co.uk/imgres, evilplots.com/texas-holdem,
www.texasholdemcenteral.com, online-casino.blest-casino.com/ , www.favorite-
casino.com/online-casino, www.sportscribe.com/poker-party, com/texas-
holdem.html, favorite-casino.com/casino.

>>

>> And so on? It's got to have something to do with page rank and Google, but
I would love to understand HOW and WHY they do it.
