[What Did Edward Snowden Get Wrong? Everything |

> Incidents like the Snowden affair put my former colleagues in the
> intelligence community in an impossible position. Yes, the official
> explanations about the virtues of data-collection efforts can sound self-
> justifying and vague. But they're still right. I know firsthand that Gen.
> Keith Alexander, the NSA director, is telling the truth when he talks about
> plots that have been preempted and attacks that have been foiled because of
> intelligence his agency collected. I know because I was on the inside, I
> have long held security clearances, and I participated in many of the
> activities he describes.
