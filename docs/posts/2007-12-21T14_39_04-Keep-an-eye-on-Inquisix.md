Here's an interesting new product, just into beta:
[Inquisix](<http://inquisix.com/>). This is a service for **sales people** who
need a more effective alternative to cold calling to generate leads.

They say: "Now there's no need to waste time on cold calling when contacts are
just an Inquisix Trusted Referral Away."

Here is something about their process:

> "… [snip] Inquisix reviews those requests and alerts only the members who
> could make those introductions. Those members review your online profile and
> reputation to determine if their customers would be interested in an
> introduction. [snip…]"

I've looked at the product (even though I am not a 'prospect' myself) and it
makes **a lot of sense**. You may want to check it out - they are taking [beta
applications.](<http://inquisix.com/invitation_requests/new>)
