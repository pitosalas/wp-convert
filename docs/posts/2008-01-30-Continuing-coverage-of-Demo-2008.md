Yesterday was a busy day! I saw lots of excellent products and ideas. I don't
know how useful the Liveblog was for y'all, but it was a handy way to have me
take notes and concentrate on what was happening. You wouldn't think you need
help concentrating, but sitting in a big dark room for hours on end can wear
out your attention span.
