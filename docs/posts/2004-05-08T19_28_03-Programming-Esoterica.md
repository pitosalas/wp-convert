handy items of information that I discover through a lot of work, for possible
future reference. 6 months later, the details will have escaped me, and so I

as a handy place for these  notes?

from it. The downside, it will be a jarring bit of geekdom to throw in the
middle of my other random ramblings and for many people it would be patently
meaningless.

experimenting with blogs and what they mean and what they are good for. And
here we goâ€¦
