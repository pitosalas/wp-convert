[ Review: The Panasonic FZ1000 II combines versatility and
value](<https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dc-fz1000-ii-
review/3>)

The Panasonic FZ1000 II is a worthy successor to the company's first large-
sensor, long-zoom bridge camera, and a value-conscious rival to the popular
Sony RX10-series. It's just as fast as its predecessor but produces nicer
JPEGs, has significantly improved controls and interface, and more.
