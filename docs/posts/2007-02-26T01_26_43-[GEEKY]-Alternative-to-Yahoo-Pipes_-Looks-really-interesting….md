I haven't looked at this yet, but it is quite intriguing.

Oh… Why haven't I looked yet? Well ever since xFruits was mentioned on
LifeHacker, it has been unable to be reached. The server is probably getting
overwhelmed by loving interest like mine.

I say "server" singular? I am just assuming that we are talking about a single
server. But even if that's not the case, the fact that the service is
unavailable right now says something about how hard it is to build a scalable
web service, especially if you are giving it away for free. It is why it's
nice to see Yahoo, Google and Amazon publishing services.
