Here's a really interesting article: ["Is Giving the Secret to Getting Ahead"?
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/is-giving-the-secret-to-getting-
ahead.html?ref=magazine>)from the New York Times. It's about a Wharton
Professor that sounds just too good to be true:

> "For Grant, helping is not the enemy of productivity, a time-sapping
> diversion from the actual work at hand; it is the mother lode, the motivator
> that spurs increased productivity and creativity. In some sense, he has
> built a career in professional motivation by trying to unpack the puzzle of
> his own success. He has always helped; he has always been productive. How,
> he has wondered for most of his professional life, does the interplay of
> those two factors work for everyone else? ( **from** ["Is Giving the Secret
> to Getting Ahead"?](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/is-giving-
> the-secret-to-getting-ahead.html?ref=magazine>))

Now I happen to believe in "what goes around comes around." And I try hard to
help people without wondering whether I will be helped in return. I can't say
I was born that way, but it's just been my experience over the years that I
seem to always get more in return than I put out.

Ok. But if you read this article, no matter how helpful you think you are,
you're not going to feel helpful enough. I guess there's always room for
improvement!
