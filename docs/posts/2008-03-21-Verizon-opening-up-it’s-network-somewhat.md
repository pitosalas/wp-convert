**Link: [Verizon opening up it’s network somewhat](None):** ""

I am starting to follow the world of [mesh
networks](<http://del.icio.us/tag/meshnetworks>) and things related to that.

One immediate question that has popped up is: now that there are cell towers
everywhere, what advantage might there be to creating a new national or global
or mobile network based on mesh technology? I am just an ignoramus so far on
this, but in that quest, I came across this article.

> Plans](<http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/verizon-details-its-open-
> wireless-plans/index.html>))

Does this allow the creation of a new class of device placed in homes or cars
or what-not that uses the cell network as it's backbone?
