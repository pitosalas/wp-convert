**Link: [Service Objects | Jared Norman](https://jardo.dev/rails-service-objects):** "Service Objects are a popular software design pattern in the Ruby on Rails community. They are used to extract procedural logic away from models and controllers and into their own objects."

Good article on an arcane topic that the ruby community loves to debate and discuss.
