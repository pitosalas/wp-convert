>> **Well, is it Dr. Dean or Governor Dean?** It's funny to me when people try
to build up Howard Dean's stature by using one or the other title, depending I
guess on what the speaker thinks sounds more impressive. I'd say given the job
he's applying for, the only relevant qualification is Governor Howard Dean.
