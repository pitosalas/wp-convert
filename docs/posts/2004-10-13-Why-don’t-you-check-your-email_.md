>> A [very interesting
piece](<http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/10/10/a_culture_of_feeds_syndication_and_youth_culture.html>)
about how people are beginning to use Instant Messaging instead of email. It's
quite counterintuitive, but it does seem to correlate in one particular
college student I know pretty well.

>>

>>> "Youth use email to talk with **parents and authorities** (including
corporate emails like from Xanga); it's where they get the functional stuff.
They check email once a day. They get notices there, but they're **mostly
disregarded.**

>>>

>>> **IM is where the action is.** Youth see this as their digital
centerpiece, where they communicate with their friends, thereby maintaining
their intimate community.

>>>

>>> They use the Profiles in IM to find out if their friends updated their LJs
or Xangas, even though they are subscribed by email as well. The only feed
they use is the LJ friends list and hyper LJ users have figured out how to
syndicate Xangas into LJ. [Remember: blog is not a meaningful term to youth
culture.]"
