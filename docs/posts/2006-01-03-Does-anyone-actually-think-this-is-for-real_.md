>>> "The idea is simple: to try and make $1m (US) by selling 1,000,000 pixels
for $1 each. Hence, 'The Million Dollar Homepage". The main motivation for
doing this is to pay for my degree studies, because I don't like the idea of
graduating with a huge student debt. I know people who are paying off student
loans 15-20 years after they graduated. Not a nice thought!" ( **from**
[Million Dollar Home Page](<http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/faq.php>))

>>> Recently I [came across the
news](<http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/blog.php>) that the last 1000
pixels were being auctioned off on eBay, meaning, if you believe it, that this
enterprising fellow has already made $999,000.00 from this site. Oh, and [lots
of
people](<http://www.bloglines.com/citations?url=http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/blog.php>)
have written about it ðŸ™‚

>>> Come on, it's gotta be a hoax!
