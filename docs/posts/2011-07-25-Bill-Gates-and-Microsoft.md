I still **don 't love Microsoft**. I used to, actually, use Windows day in and
day out, for years. But I am known to **frown** a the thought of sitting down
and usingn Windows 7 or whatever it's called these days.

But isn't **Bill Gates awesome**? After building Microsoft into a hugely
successful business behemoth he takes his money and builds an awesome
charitable behemoth:

> ""We all know that there are these exemplars who can take the toughest
> students, and they'll teach them two-and-a-half years of math in a single
> year," he says. "Well, I'm enough of a scientist to want to say, 'What is it
> about a great teacher? Is it their ability to calm down the classroom or to
> make the subject interesting? Do they give good problems and understand
> confusion? Are they good with kids who are behind? Are they good with kids
> who are ahead?' (from [The Wall Street
