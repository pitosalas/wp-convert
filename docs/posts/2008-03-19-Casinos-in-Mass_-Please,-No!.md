[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfWsfDweeM4&hl=en]I found my way onto
Robin Chase's blog, [Network Musings](<http://networkmusings.blogspot.com/>).
She writes about lots of stuff I am interested in. Starting with the top post
right now, ["Should Casinos Subsidize Car
Travel?"](<http://networkmusings.blogspot.com/2008/03/casinos-and-cars.html>)
where she says:

> "The Governor of Massachusetts has asked state legislators to seriously
> consider encouraging the building of several new large casinos in the state
> in order to raise revenues, the majority of which will be used for
> transportation shortfalls." (from [Network
> Musings](<http://networkmusings.blogspot.com/>))

In the Youtube video, which is short and worth a listen, the [bon
mot](<http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bon_mot>):

> "Legalizing Casinos in Massachusetts […] is introducing a second addiction
> to pay for our first addiction: low cost driving"
