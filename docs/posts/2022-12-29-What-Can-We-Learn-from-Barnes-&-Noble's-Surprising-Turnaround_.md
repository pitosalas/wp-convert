**Link: [What Can We Learn from Barnes & Noble's Surprising Turnaround?](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/what-can-we-learn-from-barnes-and):** "I was in a Barnes and Nobel again after many years. Actually many years before that I would go to a B&N more than once a week. Then between Amazon and terrible inventories at B&N and Kindle and Nook I stopped going. Then a few weeks ago I visited one and it was a revelation. I had a great time browsing books and books and books. Great article:"Digital platforms are struggling, meanwhile a 136-year-old book retailer is growing again. But why?""
