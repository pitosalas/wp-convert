To be honest, hardly followed the [pages and
pages](<http://del.icio.us/search/?setcount=100&all=bootcamp>) of blog
analysis of Apple's recent release of "Boot Camp" a utility allowing users to
boot WIndows XP on Macintosh Intel-based computers. Didn't seem like that big
a deal to me. Today in the New York Times, a [good op-ed
piece](<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/08/opinion/08cringely.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>)
analyzing what it may or may not mean, by [Robert X.
Cringely](<http://www.pbs.org/cringely/>). If you haven't followed the debate,
this is a good primer:

>>

>>> "HELL froze over this week as Apple Computer unveiled Boot Camp, a **free
program** that will allow its new Macintosh computers with Intel
microprocessors to run Microsoft's Windows XP operating system as an
**alternative** to Apple's OS X. The news media were agog and Apple's stock
price zoomed at the announcement. In my view, it was **mildly interesting** ,
but hardly the revolution Apple users want to see." (from "[New York Times,
Microsoft's Mac
Attack](<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/08/opinion/08cringely.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>)")
