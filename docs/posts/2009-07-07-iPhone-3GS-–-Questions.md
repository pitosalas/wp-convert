Ok so I've had the new iPhone for a little while now. This is my first ever
iPhone and I have some questions. Maybe you can help me?

  * iPhone knows how to announce the album name and artist (using the voice recognition "what song is that" command.) Then why can't I enable it to automatically announce each and every song?
  * Why is it so dang hard to convert a DVD I own to iPhone format? I tried a bunch of 'solutions' using software I already have, as well as 2 or 3 utilities I downloaded. None finished successfully. All took forever. Isn't there an easy way?

Any experts out there who want to comment?
