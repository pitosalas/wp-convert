[ Zed - Code at the speed of thought](< https://zed.dev/>) –Just to prove that
theres never the last word on anything, especially programmers editors. I
thought history ended with vscode. But take a look st this, pretty
tantilizing! Author says: “Code at the speed of thought. Zed is a high-
performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-
sitter.”
