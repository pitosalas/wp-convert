**Link: [[RubyConf] Percentage of Windows users](None):** ""



Odd thing happened in a talk at [RubyConf](<http://www.rubyconf.org>). Speaker
asks all attendees who are using Windows to raise their hands.

Looked to me like about 3% of folks here are on Windows. Now its a very biased
audience but still an interesting number!
