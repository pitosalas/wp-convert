I was amazed today when in a group of 25 undergraduate engineering students,
only three had heard the word
[kluge](<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kluge>). When I
explained what it was, it still did not ring a bell. When I asked how they
refer to an ugly, clunky, scotch-taped solution, inelegant and embarrassing,
but which basically works, they came up with "hack".

Query: Is the word
"[kluge](<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kluge>)" becoming
obsolete among the geek community?
