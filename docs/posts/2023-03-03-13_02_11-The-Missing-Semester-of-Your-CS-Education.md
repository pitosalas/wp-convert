[ The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](<
https://missing.csail.mit.edu/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav>)
–Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems
to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered,
and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with
their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful
text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!
