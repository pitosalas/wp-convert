Everyone by now has heard that the Diary of [Fake Steve Jobs is actually
written](<http://tech.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1339469.php>) by
[Daniel Lyons, a Senior Editor at
Forbes](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/technology/06steve.html>).

In a recent article, as an example, you can see, Fake Steve can be downright
catty:

> "[snip…]I pointed out to Otellini that in fact this just makes Negroponte
> look like a _jackass_ , which is why the Journal placed that statement into
> the story and attributed it to Negroponte.
>
> The way this technique works is they try to seem all cool and neutral but
> they're really making Negroponte look like a _donkey_ -- and right on Page
> One of the world's biggest business publication.
>
> Nice.[…snip]" (**from** [The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs: Give one, get one,
> right in the ass](<http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/11/give-one-get-one-
> right-in-ass.html>))

Ok this is satire. But it is tremendously harsh. And there is a [continuing
stream of aggressively mean things that he writes about Mr.
Negroponte.](<http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/search?q=negroponte>)

It's kind of amazing that now that the true writer of this stuff is known,
that this continues. I mean, sure he must get lots of traffic, but it has to
have permanently changed his reputation as a journalist.
