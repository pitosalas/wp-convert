[Esther Dyson](<http://www.edventure.com/>) wrote this very interesting [Wall
Street Journal article about how online advertising is
changing](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120269162692857749.html?mod=googlenews_wsj>).
This article is very relevant to my new product, SWIFT, which I have hinted
about before. She says:

> "The current online-advertising model will become less effective, even as it
> gets increasingly sophisticated. New players are emerging to devalue the
> spaces that the ad giants are currently fighting over. Companies you've
> never heard of called NebuAd, Project Rialto, Phorm, Frontporch and Adzilla
> are pitching tools to Internet service providers that will enable them to
> track users and show them relevant ads.
>
> This approach (called behavioral targeting and already in service by ad
> networks that track users through so-called tracking cookies) undercuts
> traditional online publishers, who employ content to lure users and to sell
> adjacent ads. Now, the ISPs can sell advertisers direct access to the same
> users." (from [Wall Street
> Journal](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120269162692857749.html?mod=googlenews_wsj>))

I suggest you [read the whole
thing](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120269162692857749.html?mod=googlenews_wsj>).
