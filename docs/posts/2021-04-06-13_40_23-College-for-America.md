(**Web site except:** College for America gives employees nationwide the chance to earn a college degree at a fraction of the traditional cost, in partnership with their employer. Our fully-accredited & transferable degree was developed by the nonprofit Southern New Hampshire University to be radically affordable, more accessible for working adults with busy lives, and more accountable for development of skills they need.)
