Over on Copyblogger, a good reminder of **[a bit of common
wisdom:](<http://www.copyblogger.com/writers-block/>)**

> "[snip…]Yep, it’s the “F” word.

F.E.A.R = "False Evidence (or Expectations) Appearing Real"

I don't remember where I first heard it. I did some digging and googling and
found these references for your further edification. You can see that it's
been around a while and has been used in all kinds of contexts…
