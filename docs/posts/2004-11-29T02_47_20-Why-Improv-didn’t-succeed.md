>> It's been a while.

>>

>> Which is why my heart beat just a **little faster** when I read a reference
to Improv (not altogether flattering) in the [Adam Bossworth piece
](<http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html>)I just wrote about, where
he said:

>>

>>> _  
> Consider the **spreadsheet**. It is a protean, sloppy, plastic, flexible
> medium that is, ironically, the despair of all accountants and auditors
> because it is virtually impossible to reliably understand a truly complex
> and rich spreadsheet.
>>>

>>> Lotus corporation (now IBM), filled with **Harvard MBA 's and PhD's in CS
**from MIT, built Improv. Improv set out "to fix all this". It was an auditors
dream. It provided rarified heights of abstraction, formalisms for rows and
columns, and in short was truly comprehensible. It **failed utterly** , not
because it failed in its ambitions but because it succeeded._

>>

>> I happen to know **a little bit** about this 🙂 **I was the guy** , for
better or worse, who came up with the idea for **Improv** and got it built and
shipped at Lotus.

>>

>> Let me start by saying I have neither a PhD nor an MBA (and proud of it!)
And I am almost positive there was not a single one of those on the Improv
team. But other than that, Adam makes I think an **important** and accurate
observation.

>>

>> This is so many years ago now so I don't think about it much anymore. But
at one point I was often asked and thought about what happened with Improv and
why it failed. And while I had more complicated answers at the time, I have to
say that **there is a lot** to what Adam says.

>>

>> It's easy to get all philosophical about what makes a spreadsheet a
spreadsheet, what it's core essence is. And I have. It's hard to argue that
one of the keys is the maleability of the spreadsheet as a medium. The fact
that a spreadsheet can grow organically, be modified and grown in a kind of an
Improvisational manner. But when spreadsheets get **complicated** they get
messy and error-prone and this is what Improv set out to address.

>>

>> In the end it didn't go anywhere, probably because in setting out to
improve on spreadsheets, Improv lost the essence of a spreadsheet and in doing
so **lost the market**.

>>

>> **Innovators Dilemma**

>>

>> There is an interesting Innovators Dilemma kind of perspective here,
referring to the now-classic book ["The Innovators Dilemma" by Clayton M.
Christensen](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0875845851/002-1504404-5645600?v=glance>).
To summarize one of the key theses of the book extremely briefly:

>>

>>   1. that a new technology might initially have a fatal flaw which makes it
unsuitable for the purpose it was intended for. (For example, Electric cars
don't have the range or speed to meet the needs of today's drivers.)

>>   2. An established maker of cars (e.g. Ford) has a strong disincentive to
invest in Electric cars because it doesn't meet the need of it's existing
customer base.

>>   3. An upstart competitor could identify a different market where the
apparent flaws (speed and range) are actually 'features' not 'bugs' (for
example a car specifically made for very young drivers) and use that market as
a spring board to be able to perfect the technology.

>>   4. Eventually the upstart has years of experience with the new technology
(the batteries and drive train) and improves it to the point where it actually
does meet the need of mainstream customers, while the established player has
been ignoring things and gets unseated.

>>

>> I am **not sure** it applies, but one could argue a parallel here with
Improv. In particular this would lead you to the conclusion that the key
strategy **mistake** was to try to market Improv to the existing spreadsheet
market. Instead, if the product were marketed to a segment where the more
structured model was a 'feature' not a 'bug' would have given Lotus the time
to learn and improve and refine the model to a point where it would have
**satisfied** the larger market as well.

>>

>> Who knows. Ancient history.
