# [Amazon Web Services Gets Another Hiccup](None)




I've wondered and written before about the 'downside' or 'risk' of building
your application based on one of the excellent SAAS services from Amazon. And
I do think they are excellent. But check this post [Amazon Web Services Gets
Another Hiccup](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/265636579/>)
from [TechCrunch](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch>):

> Amazon to be able to scale their computing resources on demand and do it

> unavailability is unacceptable. At least this one happened during the middle
> of the night."
