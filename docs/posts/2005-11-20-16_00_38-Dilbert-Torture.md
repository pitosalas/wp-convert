>> [According to Dilbert (or is it Scott
Adams](<http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/interrogation_t.html>))
we are approaching the whole question of torture in the wrong way:

>>

>>> "The objective is to think up a form of torture that's effective but
doesn't sound so bad when the rest of the world finds out you did it. " (
**from**
[Dilbert.Blog](<http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/interrogation_t.html>))

>>

>> So here's what he's thought up:

>>

>>> "It occurred to me recently after having surgery for my deviated septum
that lots of Al Qaeda members must need that same procedure. When Amnesty
International finds out that we gave free medical care to prisoners, that
won't sound so bad." ( **from**
[Dilbert.Blog](<http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/interrogation_t.html>))

>>

>> and…

>>

>>> "…we could give them spa packages that involve waxing the hair off of most
of their bodies. I realize this is an overgeneralization, but terrorists seem
extra hairy to me. So it would probably hurt extra much." ( **from**
[Dilbert.Blog](<http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/interrogation_t.html>))
