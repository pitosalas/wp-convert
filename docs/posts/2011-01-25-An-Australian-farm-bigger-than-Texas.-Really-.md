I heard yesterday that there is "at least one farm" in Australia bigger than
Texas. I guess this was a way to remind me that Australia is really really
big. Which I think I knew already so I let it go.

But then I got to thinking, Texas is pretty big too, and a single farm that
size was still a little hard to believe. So I am looking for data. Can anyone
prove or disprove the statement?
