(**Web site except:** Maybe a startup is the best way to meet a goal, and maybe it isn’t. If the goal of the young man described above is to run a business –&nbsp;any business! –&nbsp;then perhaps a startup is indeed his best path forward. For others, though, I often wonder if they’re fitting their goals into the format of a startup because it’s an approach that’s lauded, admired, and easily understood (if not easily accomplished).)
