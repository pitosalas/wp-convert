Apparently (not sure why yet) on Android, sound effects files using the OGG
format work better than those using wav or mp3. It might be an AndEngine
thing, I am not sure. Anyway, here's my result of half hour googling and
experimenting for a reliable way to convert the files. I tried a bunch of
things, and I finally settled on [MediaHuman
AudioConverter.](<http://www.mediahuman.com/?app=mhac&ver=1.2>) Use it. It
really works and is nice and simple.
