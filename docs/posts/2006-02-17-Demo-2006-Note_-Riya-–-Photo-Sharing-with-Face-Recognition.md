[This one was probably one of the most talked about
sites](<http://www.riya.com>). The principle is, Flickr is nice, but no one
really wants to take the time to tag. So instead, with Riya, after you upload
your images, you can search for them based on who is in them and where they
were taken. But the trick is that it uses image recognition to help you locate
the pictures. Pretty impressive! [Check out Riya](<http://www.riya.com>).
