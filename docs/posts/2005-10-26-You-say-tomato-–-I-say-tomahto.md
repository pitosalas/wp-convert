The street filled with tomatoes, midday, summer, light is halved like a
tomato, its juice runs through the streets. In December, unabated, the tomato
invades the kitchen, it enters at lunchtime, takes its ease on countertops,
among glasses, butter dishes, blue saltcellars. It sheds its own light, benign
majesty. Unfortunately, we must murder it: the knife sinks into living flesh,
red viscera a cool sun, profound, inexhaustible, populates the salads of
Chile, happily, it is wed to the clear onion, and to celebrate the union we
pour oil, essential child of the olive, onto its halved hemispheres, pepper
adds its fragrance, salt, its magnetism; it is the wedding of the day, parsley
hoists its flag, potatoes bubble vigorously, the aroma of the roast knocks at
the door, it's time! come on! and, on the table, at the midpoint of summer,
the tomato, star of earth, recurrent and fertile star, displays its
convolutions, its canals, its remarkable amplitude and abundance, no pit, no
husk, no leaves or thorns, the tomato offers its gift of fiery color and cool
completeness. **By Pablo Neruda** Technorati Tags:
