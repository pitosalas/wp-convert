So after some trouble porting the content I am now running my blog on
[Squarespace](<http://www.squarespace.com>). My main motivation is to get out
of the server management business and also clean up my messier and messier
self-hosted WordPress.

Jury is still out whether this will be a keeper but for the moment I am happy
and really like the fresher look of the blog compared to the previous
incarnation. I will certainly keep you posted!
