I am a really big fan of the book [The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs
Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful
Businesses](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307887898&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0307887898). So much so that I am
using it as a "textbook" for the Entrepreneurship course I am teaching at
[Olin College](<http://www.olin.edu>).

Oddly enough, I couldn't find the word "market" in the index.
