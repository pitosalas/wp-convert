[ Home - Coder v1 v1.32 docs](< https://coder.com/docs/coder/latest>) –This
looks pretty interesting. Sort of what I've been trying to home grow. "Coder
is a self-hosted platform that allows organizations to securely provision
developer workspaces (featuring remote IDEs and all related resources) for
DevOps, platform, and software engineering teams."
