From ABC News, but I've seen a similar story elsewhere:

> "There are 300 million [third-party
> charges](<http://abcnews.go.com/Business/FinancialSecurity/tips-combating-
> mysterious-hidden-fees-phone-bill/story?id=14063183>) totaling $2 billion on
> U.S. phone bills each year, according to the Senate Commerce Committee.
>
> What's more, according to the Federal Communications Commission, about 15
> million to 20 million households are overcharged for their telephone
> landlines by third-party companies but only 5 percent realize they are
> victims."

Here's the article: "[Phone Bill Fees: How to Identify 3rd-Party Charges and
Protect Yourself](<http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=14065780&sid=74>)".

The article seems to focus on landlines. Does that mean that this problem does
not occur with cell phones? That would be good to know?
