![](http://www.triplemint.com/.a/6a00d834517dbc69e2010534a36f66970b-pi)I came
across this ad in the New York Times magazine. I should say, I was riveted by
this ad. Is this a real building? Is it built yet? You have to take a look at
some of the images on (what I think is) [their main site.

But really the ad in the magazine is the one that is still the most
impressive.

Which leaves me with the question, is this thing a good idea? I wonder?

Just quickly looking around some of the stuff I read online about it leaves me
with the question of whether this is an architectural/engineering/construction
tour the force which in the end will not much improve the world.
