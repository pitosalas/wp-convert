>> **Wonderful Mars pictures? Unavailable!** I was looking around the [Mars
Rover Web](<http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html>) site for some of
those amazing pictures, and to my surprise they are now asking for a password
to get into the ['raw
images'](<http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/spirit.html>) area. I've
got to believe that this is not for security but because their server was
getting totally beat up by people like me browsing around.

>> **Hmm, maybe they should use some warez technology?** Here maybe for the
first time is a very ligitimate, legal, and useful place where [Bit
Torrent](<http://www.bittorent.com/>) and other clever file sharing
technologies could be used as a force for good 🙂
