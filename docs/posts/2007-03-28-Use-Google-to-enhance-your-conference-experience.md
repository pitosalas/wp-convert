# [Use Google to enhance your conference experience](None)




I'm at the [O'Reilly Emerging Technology
Conference](<http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/>), aka "ETech"â€¦ really
interesting. One 'trick' that just occurred to me is working well. When
confronted with a series of sessions in the same time slot, instead of just
going by the title of the talk, a quick google on the speaker is a great way
to select which session to go to.

For example, the next time slot has 5 presentations by people I didn't know:
[Gil
Penchina](<http://www.google.com/search?q=gil+penchina&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-

Biddle](<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-
US%3Aofficial&hs=7Df&q=peter+biddle&btnG=Search>), [Richard
Sprague](<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-
US%3Aofficial&hs=ZEf&q=richard+sprague&btnG=Search>), [Simon
Wardley](<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-
US%3Aofficial&hs=rFf&q=simon+wardley&btnG=Search>) and [Adrian
McDermott.](<http://www.google.com/search?q=adrian+mcdermott&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a>) (Yeah it's my failing that I didn't know you
guys, if you find this post ego-surfing ðŸ™‚

But anyway, despite some very non-descriptive session titles, thanks to
google, I now know what which one I want to go to.
