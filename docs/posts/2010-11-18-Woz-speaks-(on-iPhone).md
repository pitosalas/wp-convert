# [Woz speaks (on iPhone)](None)




I happen to be reading iWoz, which is Steve Wozniak's
memoir/biography/whatever. It's a very breezy easy read and fun if you follow
this kind of thing. So naturally this caught my eye:

> "Woz then moved on to the topic of Android saying that Android smartphones,
> not the iPhone, would become dominant, noting that the Google OS is likely
> to win the race similarly to the way that Windows ultimately dominated the
> PC world. Woz stressed that the iPhone, "Has very few weak points. There
> aren't any real complaints and problems." (from "Steve Wozniak[: Android
> will be the dominant smartphone
> platform](<http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/18/steve-wozniak-android-will-be-
> the-dominant-smartphone-platform/>)")

Of course Engadget may not have selected the particular headline that Woz
would have liked, because he also lavished praise on the iPhone saying it has
""Has very few weak points. There aren't any real complaints and problems. In
terms of quality, the iPhone is leading."
