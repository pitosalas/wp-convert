**Link: [Bush on TV, quoting two blogs](None):** ""



Is this a sign of the times? President Bush is on TV right now giving a speech
about why he's right about Iraq. To bolster his case, he quotes two bloggers
located in Baghdad! (Jokingly: "yeah, they have bloggers in Baghdad too, heh,
heh") Of course he doesn't cite the sources or the links so I can't tell
anything about where the flowery quotes come from. Still it's a sign of the
stature that blogs are getting in the public discourse.
