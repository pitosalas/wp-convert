(**Web site except:** Many gas smokers have limited temperature range and can't get down and hold low and slow temps of 225⁰. We reviewed this big beauty that can go down to 160⁰ and crank up to 400⁰! AND it converts to natural gas so you don't have to worry about you LP tank running out. We tested this model and gave it our AmazingRibs.com Platinum Medal.)
