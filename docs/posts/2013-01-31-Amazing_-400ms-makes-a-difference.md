Under the header "Natural Gas News Leak" (funny) there's a [story about how
the securities market reacted 400ms before a bit of news came out of the
government](<http://www.nanex.net/aqck2/4090.html>) and they reacted by
trading on the news. The article has lots of charts and graphs which may say
whether or how much money was made or lost. The article says:

> "It is worth pointing out that the EIA Natural Gas Report comes out weekly
> (every Thursday at 10:30) and the market reacts within a few milliseconds.
> This is because the report centers on one number which makes it easy for
> machines to process and take action." ( **from**
> [Nanex.net](<http://www.nanex.net/aqck2/4090.html>))
