# [It’s probably not cool to say, but I am not sure about “Mayday.Us”](None)




"We’re kickstarting a Super PAC big enough to make it possible to win a
Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016. We set fundraising goals and
then crowdfund those goals."

Lofty goal but so vague I can't tell which way is up!

I remember something that sounded similar, a few years ago: It was called[
Americans Elect.](<http://www.salas.com/blog/2012/5/6/field-of-dreams-
americans-elect.html>) They had awesome goals, and they even got Thomas
Friedman to endorse them. Like Lawrence Lessig. (See I don't say "Larry"
because we aren't really on a first name basis 🙂 The problem is that Americans
Elect failed miserably, and there was even some buzz that it was some kind of
a front for less savory operators who I would not have supported if I had
known them. I honestly don't remember the details anymore but it did make me
less willing to jump in an support positive but vague sounding causes.

So I am not ready to jump in with both feet into Mayday.Us.
