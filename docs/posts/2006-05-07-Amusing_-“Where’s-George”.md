Check out this odd little site, "[Where's
George](<http://www.wheresgeorge.com>)", especially for people with time on
their hands. People enter in the serial number of a dollar bill, and the
[site](<http://www.wheresgeorge.com>) tries to track it's travel through the
country. The power of the net.

>> Interestingly, in
[this](<http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/web_game_provides_breakthrough_in_predicting_spread_of_epidemics_9874>)
(and several other) article, they say that using the patterns detected by
Where's George (they call it a game) scientists actually have learned useful
new things about the spread of infectious diseases in the USA, a very "au
courant" topic.

>>> "We were confident that we could learn a lot from the data collected at
the www.wheresgeorge.com bill-tracking website, but the results turned out far
beyond our expectations," said Lars Hufnagel, a post-doctoral fellow at the
Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa
Barbara and co-author of an article describing the research in the January 26
issue of the journal Nature" ( **from** [Science
Blog](<http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/web_game_provides_breakthrough_in_predicting_spread_of_epidemics_9874>))
