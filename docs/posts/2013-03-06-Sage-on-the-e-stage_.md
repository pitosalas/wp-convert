There are fascinating shifts going on in higher education today, from MOOCs to
the 'flipped classroom'. A lot of action. I think we are looking at another
text-book "Innovator's Dilemma" scenario playing out:

The established players (traditional universities), aware of a new way of
delivering their offer, but seeing that it doesn't meet the needs of their
customer's as well as the old way. And the upstarts (udemy and others), the
disruptors, applying and refining the use of the technology in niche markets,
eventually perfecting it to the point that they can blow by the laggards, and
leave them in the dust. Textbook!

Check out today's New York Times:

> "Institutions of higher learning must move, as the historian Walter Russell
> Mead puts it, from a model of “time served” to a model of “stuff learned.”
> Because increasingly the world does not care what you know. Everything is on
> Google. The world only cares, and will only pay for, what you can do with
> what you know." ( **from**[New York Times: The Professor's Big
> Stage](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/opinion/friedman-the-professors-
> big-stage.html?_r=0>))
