[ OpenCV: Detection of ArUco
Markers](<https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html>)

Pose estimation is of great importance in many computer vision applications:
robot navigation, augmented reality, and many more. This process is based on
finding correspondences between points in the real environment and their 2d
image projection. This is usually a difficult step, and thus it is common to
use synthetic or fiducial markers to make it easier.
