Here's a new online light weight database product that picks up where
[QuickBase](<http://www.quickbase.com/p/home.asp>) leaves off and goes crazy.
It's called [**blist**](<http://www.blist.com>). It has a far snazzier (and
more complicated) user interface than
[Quickbase](<http://quickbase.intuit.com>).

In good old [SAT](<http://www.collegeboard.com/splash/>) fashion,
[Quickbase](<http://quickbase.intuit.com>) is to
[Blist](<http://www.blist.com>) as [Google Docs](<http://docs.google.com>) is
to [Buzzword](<http://www.buzzword.com>), which by the way, you should check
out also!

I am not taking sides, but next time you need a web based, light weight, list
or database, you should check out both QuickBase and blist.
