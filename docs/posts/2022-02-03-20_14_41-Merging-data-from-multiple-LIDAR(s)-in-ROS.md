(**Web site except:** Light radars or LIDARs are used in robotics, drone engineering, IoT etc. for a wide range of applications. A typical lidar uses ultraviolet, visible, or near infrared light to image objects. It can target a wide range of materials, including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols, clouds and even single molecules. They are used extensively in building autonomous systems such navigation, detection, task actuation etc.
