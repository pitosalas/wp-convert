>>

>> Java Web Start is a piece of Java platform that's meant to ease the
deployment and updating of Java applications. It's a great idea, but
disappointingly implemented. There were several JavaOne sessions about Web
Start.

>>

>> There are some great enhancements coming in Java 5.0 (1.5)

>>

>>   * A semi-miraculous JAR compression technology (called Pack200, who knows
why) which in some cases achieves a claimed 10-1 compression. You need to know
that Java applications are notoriously huge because and so this is welcome
news.

>>   * Beyond this, there are a set of features allowing more control of the
placement of shortcuts, onto the desktop, in the start menu, and various other
items.

>>

>> However, disappointingly, I have to say that they still don't get it. If
Java wants to support the creation of no-compromise user experiences on the
desktop more is needed:

>>

>>   * there is insufficient control of shortcut placement

>>   * there still is no crossplataform, cross browser, automatic download of
the required run time libraries (JRE)

>>

>> And worse, when asked when these and other deficiencies would get corrected
the speaker said something along the lines of: "oh those are good ideas that
we are talking about. We'll consider it for the next release."

>>

>> With 1.5 to 2.5 year release cycle this is not really good enough
