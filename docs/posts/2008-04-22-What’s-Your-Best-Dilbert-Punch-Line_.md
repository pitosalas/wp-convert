Amazing idea from Scott Adams. Dilbert Mashups. Check this post [What’s Your
Best Dilbert Punch Line?](<http://mashable.com/2008/04/21/dilbert-mashups/>)
from [Mashable!](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/mashable>):

> "Dilbert has a huge following and I’m sure lots of people will have fun
> making their own punch lines for the popular comic, and there are even a few
> sharing options (embedding, email, social bookmarking, etc.) that will allow
> those Dilber writer-wannabes to share their humorous wit with friends across
> the web. One drawback, though, is the fact that you can only create a mashup
> for the current day’s comic strip." Check it out!
