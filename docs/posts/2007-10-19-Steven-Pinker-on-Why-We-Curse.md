**Link: [Steven Pinker on Why We Curse](None):** ""



I know that access to my blog is blocked at least by EMC (heard so from
friends there) so I will refrain from quoting [this
article's](<http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20071008&s=pinker100807>) first
word:

> "*ucking became the subject of congressional debate in 2003, after NBC
> broadcast the Golden Globe Awards. Bono, lead singer of the mega-band U2,
> was accepting a prize on behalf of the group and in his euphoria exclaimed,
> "This is really, really, *ucking brilliant" on the air." (from Pinker on Why
> We Curse)

It's actually a serious article about linguistics, culture and human nature.
Well written, well reasoned and interesting. Read [Steven Pinker, Why We
Curse, "What the
F***?"](<http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20071008&s=pinker100807>)
