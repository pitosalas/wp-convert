# [Check out WriteThatName](None)




I've been using a app called
"[WriteThatName](<https://writethat.name/live/webapp/en/settings.html?pin=1941955007.5125032531&o=7&t=en-
en-v2-referrals-announce&v=0>)" which very helpfully scans the emails I
receive for signature blocks with people's name. It takes that info and
correctly parses it and adds it to my google contacts. Super nice. I
[recommend](<https://writethat.name/live/webapp/en/settings.html?pin=1941955007.5125032531&o=7&t=en-
en-v2-referrals-announce&v=0>) it!
