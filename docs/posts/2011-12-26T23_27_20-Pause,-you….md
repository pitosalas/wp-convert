I saw this quote from Dickens' Great Expectations. I had to read it several
times to get the meaning. It's appropriate for this season.

> "Pause you," Pip says, "and think for a moment of the long chain of iron
> or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the
> formation of the first link on one memorable day." ( **from** Dickens, as
> quoted by [Maureen Dowd in the New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/opinion/sunday/dowd-a-victorian-
> christmas.html?_r=1&ref=opinion>))
