I haven't seen anyone pointing to this [article about TechCrunch and Professor
Arrington](<http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-07/ff_arrington#>),
but it's very interesting. I remember when it was first starting and how he
would write an unbelievable number of interesting and useful reviews about new
products. Mike Arrington was a machine! Say what you will about him,
TechCrunch is the labor of some extremely hard work:

> "Of course, Arrington's success is about more than partying like a frat boy
> and schmoozing like a Hollywood agent at a cast party. With the exception of
> a three-week vacation (during which he worked half-time) at the end of 2006,
> he says he has worked every day for two years straight.
>
> He gets up at about 10 or 11 am, is at his desk 10 seconds later, and tends
> to the business side of his operation until early evening, seeing
> entrepreneurs, doing phone interviews, tracking the news of the day, and
> writing posts. He's often at parties or other events until 10. It's
> typically not until 10 or 11 pm, when things quiet down, that he has time to
> think and write more thoughtful, analytical blog entries. "I've actually cut
> back," he says. " from [TecCrunch Blogger Michael Arrington Can Generate
