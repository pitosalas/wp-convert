**Link: [Windows 8: Getting a new filesystem](None):** ""

I don't pay much attention to Microsoft and Windows these days. I admit it, I
am a hardcore Mac and Linux user, more comfortable in the unix shell than I
ever was at a Dos prompt.

It's easy to forget the layers and layers and layers of complexity that exist
in any operating system nowadays, even a little Android tablet (which I am
spending lots of time with lately.)

So this article is a **good reminder** of what's happening up in Redmond. It
describes the "[next generation file system for
Windows](<http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/16/building-the-next-
generation-file-system-for-windows-refs.aspx>)":

Reading the article is not as satisfying as the build up. I guess not
surprisingly, given that by definition the article has to over simplify and
really hide the wheels within wheels.

I have written many times about Microsoft's [amazing ability to build complex
products and support a user base across a crazy variety of versions, hardware,
software, countries, eras and so on.
](</imported-20111103233638/2005/1/22/day-of-reckoning-coming-for-
microsoft.html>) The challenge that they take on with Windows 8, apparently
massively changing the on-disk structures of their file system while
preserving API compatibility is daunting.

So while I am not a Microsoft fan or booster, I still have enormous respect
for them.
