>> FUSHUN, China -- Bao Xishun, the world's tallest man, reaches in  
>  to retrieve objects from the stomach of a sick dolphin at an  
>  aquarium in Fushun, in China's northern Liaoning province. Bao,  
>  whose arms measure more than a meter in length, was called in by  
>  the aquarium after experts failed to surgically remove  
>  unidentified objects from the stomachs of two dolphins. Bao was  
>  able to reach in and retrieve the objects, which turned out to  
>  be pieces of plastic from their pool surround.
