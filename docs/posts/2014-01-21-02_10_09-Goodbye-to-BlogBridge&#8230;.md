a glorious run of almost 10 years, regretfully, I've decided to decomission
BlogBridge. My longtime freinds and blog followers will remember that I and
Aleksey worked on BlogBridge quite intensively for several years, and then
gradually less and less.

Over the last several years BlogBridge was more or less on auto pilot, but
still with a decent set of devoted users. And every week and month brought in
additional users. Not a huge amount but enough to keep it interesting.

Our pricing model was very lopsided, with most of the features being available
for free, and then two levels of paid use, the basic (for $20 per year) and
publisher (for $100 per year.) While we should have done more experimenting on
the pricing, the fact is that there were lots of good alternatives available
for free. So it was a tough (bad?) market fromt he start.

It was a labor of love. A comparitively tiny amount of money was actually
spent on it but really compared to the labor that went into designing and
implementing BlogBridge, it was truly a labor of love.

So herewith the news that BlogBridge is no longer available as a supported
product. While it still has innovations that have not been copied in newer
products, the fact is that the interest in dedicated rss readers has passed
and it does not make commercial sense to continue. Actually, it hasn't made
commercial sense for several years, but I am sentimental about it!

How does that song go again? "Thanks for the memories….."
