[Gavin Murphy](<http://www.linkedin.com/in/gavinmurphy>) (of
[Annkissam](<http://www.annkissam.com/>)) and I have been talking about the
implementation of an idea that has [been floating around the philanthropic
community](<http://munnecke.com/blog/?tag=microphilanthropy>) for a while,
which is leveraging the web to create kind of a match making service where
grass roots community projects who need people, equipment, expertise or money
can be matched up with individuals and organizations who have indicated their
willingness to offer those.

We recently were asked by [Mass High Tech](<http://www.masshightech.com/>) if
we wanted to write an op-ed about the project, and it just came out today. The
purpose of the article as much as anything is to find out if there is interest
and support for doing such a project. Here's the **last paragraph** of the
article:

> "Does [resourcematcher.org] make sense to you? We are looking for partners
> who believe in the potential of this idea and are interested in working with
> us to make it a reality. If your organization would like to discuss ways in
> which to partner with us, please get in touch." (**from** [Mass High
> Tech](<http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2009/08/17/editorial2-Web-
> ResourceMatcher-used-to-help-those-in-need.html>))

Separately, I also participated in a [podcast](<http://ow.ly/kCt9>) where I
described more details about the history and background of the project. You
can find it at [Blog Talk Radio, on the Social Actions
section](<http://ow.ly/kCt9>).

If you are interested in knowing more, or better still, helping us get this
off the ground, please, get in touch or post a comment!
