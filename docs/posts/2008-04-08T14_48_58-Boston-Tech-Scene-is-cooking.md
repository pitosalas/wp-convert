Last week I went to the monthly ["WebInno" - web innovators group -
](<http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/>)meeting at the Sonesta in Cambridge,
Massachusetts (USA). I am **quite impressed** with the attendance and the
quality of the people presenting.

The gathering was quite crowded and the buzz was very loud, lots of dynamic
discussions going on all over the place, people trading war stories and
comparing products. It was **stimulating and fun,** and I plan to go next
month again.

In the meanwhile, Don Dodge of Microsoft writes a post "[Boston Startup Events
and Resources" with quite a schedule of upcoming tech events in the Boston
area](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheNextBigThing/~3/266292175/boston-
startup.html>). I thought I was in the loop, but guess what, there's something
going on tonight in Waltham that I had never heard of, so I will be there too.

It's the so-called ["Tech
Tuesday"](<http://function.masstlc.org/programs_new/event_single.cfm?eventid=823>)
event, organized by [Dan Bricklin](<http://danbricklin.com/log/>), apparently
with the collaboration of the [mass technology leadership
council](<http://www.masstlc.org/eve/>). In a break with convention and
tradition, it is not a free event for non-members. I guess they have to keep
the MTLC staffers employed ðŸ˜‰ Still it should be fun.

So for all you "Boston is cool but I wish I lived in silcon valley" types, I
say, stop it already, there's a lot lot going on here. You just have to look!
