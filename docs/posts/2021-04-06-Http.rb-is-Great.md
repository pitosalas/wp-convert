* **Web site excerpt:** The Ruby ecosystem has many HTTP clients gems to choose from. Some are built on libcurl (Typhoeus, Curb, Patron), some on Rubyâ€™s Net::HTTP (RestClient, HTTParty, Nestful), some in pure Ruby (HTTPClient, Excon, http.rb), and some are wrappers around existing libraries (Faraday, HTTPI).
