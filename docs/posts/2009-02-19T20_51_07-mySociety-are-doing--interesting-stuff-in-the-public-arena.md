A british organization (or should I say organisation?) called mySociety has
done some **really cool** publically minded open source projects.

Sites like [FixMyStreet](<http://www.fixmystreet.com/>) and
[WhatDoTheyKnow](<http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/>) make so much sense and it
would seem to me could **easily be done** here in the USA.

**How about** it, shall we do it. It **doesn 't seem too hard**!

Check out this post by Tom Steinberg where he muses about how they might be
even able to do more: [Why I Want a Million
Quid](<http://www.mysociety.org/2009/02/19/why-i-want-a-million-quid/>):

> They take maintenance, sure, many tens of thousands of pounds a year once
