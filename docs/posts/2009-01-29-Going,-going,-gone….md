You've heard me bemoan the death of magazines, newspapers, and other valuable
things (radio? small software products) that we are killing by demanding and
expecting them to become cheaper and cheaper, and eventually free. And after
that, "gone".

Here's an interesting idea: [make newspapers into non-profits, supported by
endowments and fund raising, sort of like Public Radio and
Television](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/opinion/28swensen.html?_r=1&hp>).

> forces that are now tearing them down." (from [New York Times - News You Can
> Endow](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/opinion/28swensen.html?_r=1&hp>))
