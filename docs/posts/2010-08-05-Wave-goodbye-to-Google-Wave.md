Google leaves products in Beta forever, they say.

Not Google Wave. They actually announced [Wave's impending
cancellation.](<http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-

This really stinks, Google. I've begun to really on rely and evangelize Wave.
It's true that it took me a long time to understand it and had to do a good
deal of convincing of other people to use it. For me it has been great.

Will I be able to live without it? Sure, nothing is irreplaceable. Google
Buzz, on the other hand, lasted about 2 weeks with me. It was truly useless.
