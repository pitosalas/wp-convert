My purely biased view of the most memorable presenters, quotes and associated
links:

  * [Kiva.org](<http://www.kiva.org>) uses their web site to allow you and me to make micro loans to entrepreneurs around the world. [Jessica Flannery](<http://www.kiva.org/about/story/>) gave a terrific and enthusiastic talk and got me to go right to the site and sign up.Here's [Ethan Zuckerman's exhaustive live blog of the Kiva presentation.](<http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fethanzuckerman.com%2Fblog%2F2007%2F10%2F18%2Fpoptech-jessica-flannery-explains-kiva%2F&ei=pDQiR8f7HJaYeomI6bIC&usg=AFQjCNHdbu5RaeIv3l29TxhV3685yf5low&sig2=dcm4bJabjW5SRm_sVr_1Bw>)

  * [Chris Jordan creates amazing photographs](<http://www.chrisjordan.com/>) illustrating and driving home some amazing information and statistics. And here's [Ethan Z.'s exhaustive coverage of Chris Jordan's stuff.](<http://ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/18/poptech-chris-jordan-and-imaging-consumerism/>)

  * Quote heard in the corridors: _" The size of the font on the name badges is directly proportional to the price of attending the conference."_

  * According to [Dan Pink, author of "A Whole New Mind": ](<http://www.danpink.com/>)these are the keys to giving a memorable speech: " _Brevity, Levity, and Repetition_ " (and repetition). [Here's Ethan's blogging about Dan's presentation](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/18/poptech-daniel-pinks-whole-new-economy/>).

  * According to [Dan Gilbert](<http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm>) ([see also Ethan Z's coverage](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/19/poptech-happiness-and-risk/>)), we humans are best at recognizing and responding to threats when it has all these characteristics. The fewer of them, the less likely it is that we will take a threat seriously. (Global Climate Change as an example.) 

    * The threat has a human face

    * We see the threat as imminent

    * The threat develops rapidly enough so we notice it

    * Imagining the outcome threatened triggers revulsion and disgust

  * A [good panel called Dialog with/in Islam](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/20/poptech-dialog-within-islam/>), where I learned that According to [Mustafa Ceric](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Ef._Ceri%C4%87>), it is important to always understand and distinguish between: 

    * **Religion** : which is a community, a social structure, an organization

    * **Morality** : which is the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong

    * **Faith** : Which is a personal thing: everyone has faith in _something_ or _someone_

  * Check out [Ethan Zuckerman's amazingly detailed blogging about each and every Pop!Tech speaker](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/category/poptech-2007/>) -- the rest of his blog is pretty cool too.

  * In retrospect, and everyone asks this, my personal favorite and most memorable speakers: Jessica Flannery, Chris Jordan, Steven Pinker, [Van Jones](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/20/poptech-green-collar-jobs/>), [Bill Shannon, ](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/20/poptech-bill-shannon-gets-around/>)[Elizabeth Streb](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/20/poptech-elizabeth-streb-i-prefer-the-crash/>), [Cary Fowler, ](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/19/poptech-backing-up-global-agriculture/>)[Carl Honoré, ](<http://http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/19/poptech-slowing-down-with-carl-honore/>) [Jonathan Harris.](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/10/19/poptech-jonathan-harris-and-digital-storytelling/>)
