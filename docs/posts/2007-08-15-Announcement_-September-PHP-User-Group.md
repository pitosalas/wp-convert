> management systems, ecommerce sites and more. Take any list of Web 2.0 sites
> and you’ll find that more than 50% have PHP as back-end technology. What is
> less known is that PHP is also making significant inroads in the enterprise.
> Join BostonPHP, IBM and Zend as we discuss where "Enterprise" PHP (and OSS)
