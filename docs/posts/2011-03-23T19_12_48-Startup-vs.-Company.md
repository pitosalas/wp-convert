**" Oh yeah, I've started 6 companies, and right now I have 3 startups going.
I just love starting companies. I don't know what's wrong with meâ€¦."**

Have you ever heard statements like that?

I hear them, fairly often, and I am never sure what to make of them. My
immediate impulse is to call "Bullshit", but I don't because part of me
admires that attitude. It's just like the moniker "Serial Entrepreneur" seems
to have become a status symbol. It doesn't matter if the result of your
seriality is that you are broke or forced the indignity of becoming a
'salaryman' at a regular company, oh, like Google. Being a serial Entrepreneur
is cool.

I hope you realize that I am being ironic. I happen to think that Google is an
amazing company and people who have a job there have it good and have reason
to be proud.

So, I enjoyed reading ["Startup vs. Company"](<http://spencerfry.com/startup-
vs-company>) a blog post by Spencer Fry, with the subtitle "Startups easy.
Companies hard.", in which he says, among other things:

> "They tried to claim that they were currently working on a half dozen
> startups (what I'd term "projects"; a startup needs focused development),
> and as the dispute developed they also insisted that Facebook and Twitter
> were still startups and not companies. "You can't use the term for
> everything," I said, "just because it's an online product." Maybe it's a New
> York vs. San Francisco thing, but in New York we're building companies, not
> startups. Maybe it's because it costs more to live here, but we're trying to
> put food on the table, not be on the [cover of Business
> Week](<http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/dont_believe_businessweeks_bubblemath.php>
> "Business Week")." ( **from** [Startup vs.
> Company](<http://spencerfry.com/startup-vs-company>))

(It will make [Scott
Kirsner's](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/>) heart beat
faster when he realizes that the conversation being quoted above was between
Spencer Fry, from **New York** , and ' **two guys from San Fransisco** " about
the meaning of the word 'Startup')

I take Spencer Fry's side in this debate. The term 'startup' and 'company', at
least in the mouths of our community, have experienced serious devaluation:

> "What makes creating a company so difficult is that it's no longer a couple
> of people sitting around their apartment fine-tuning an idea. Those were the
> days! It's a team, all working together to solve a complex problem. Then if
> you're lucky enough to solve it, you have to sell, market, and support it.
> It starts to get scary.

> Building a business is mind numbing when you think about it. You have to be
> a little insane to venture down this path. Your chances of succeeding are
> slim, and even if you do succeed you have to continue to innovate or you'll
> be obsolete in eighteen months." ( **from** [Startup vs.
> Company](<http://spencerfry.com/startup-vs-company>))

Just something to keep in mind the next time you say or hear a statement like
I began with.
