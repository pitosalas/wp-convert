So, if you are writing one of those emails that you have to get right, and you
plan to check and proof and think about, then don't start by typing the To:.
As long as you don't type the To: you can't accidentally send it out before
you finish writing it. Once you write the To:, and accidental or careless send
will possibly cause collateral damage if you're not done word smithing your
message.
