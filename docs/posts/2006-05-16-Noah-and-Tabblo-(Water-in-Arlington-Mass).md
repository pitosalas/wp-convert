you may have heard, we've had torrential (and I mean torrential) downpours
here in Massachusetts. I happen to live on a little isthmus ([look it
up](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus>)) [between the upper and lower
Mystic Lakes in Arlington
Massachusetts](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus>).  [![ Miscellaneous

5 or 10 years the Upper Mystic Lake decides that **it wants to shake hands**
with the Lower Mystic Lake and basically water flows right through someone's
back yard.  Well it happened again this time, and a neighbor collected some
amazing pictures of the excitement. As you can see, for the first time ever I
think, the **National Guard** was called in to help deal with the situation.
Quite exciting.  [![Tabblo:

took the opportunity to play with a new product called
[Tabblo](<http://www.tabblo.com/studio/>) and built this page in **exactly 5
minutes** using the images as raw material. Very nicely done! Here's the
caption:

>>> We live in a neighborhood in Arlington Mass that sits right between the
upper and lower Mystic Lakes. As happens once every five or 10 years, with
enough rain the upper and lower Mystic lakes link up, unfortunately right
through somebody's yard. Here are some excellent pictures of that experience!
