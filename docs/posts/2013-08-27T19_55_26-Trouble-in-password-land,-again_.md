I was rather pleased with myself!

I have been changing all my passwords to easier to remember but supposedly
harder to crack passwords. I had read, on good authority, that making a
password longer was a better protection that using lots of funky characters.
So for example, I set my gmail password to "when-i-need-to-send-mail". Nice
and long. Also, sites that check a password for safety, tell me that's a good
password. http://www.passwordmeter.com gives it a 100% - "Very Strong".

I admit that my inutition was confused. I was using common english words. Even
though I have a lot of them and a long overall password length, it did feel
like it was not as secure as the experts were telling me…

Shoot. Here we go again. Now it seems simple length is not good enough,
occording to this article.
