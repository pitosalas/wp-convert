If you are a hardcore blog reader like I am, and like [BlogBridge
fans](<http://www.blogbridge.com> "Best blog reader for financial analysts,
researchers, investors, fund managers") are, it's worth giving a little
thought to what this article is saying:

> "I read this and thrashed and spluttered like Yosemite Sam for a while
> before I admitted it: he’s right. It is a self-created problem, and I need
> to understand what makes me feel the need to consume the equivalent of a
> Carnegie library every day, instead of just finding a more efficient way to
> choke it down." (from [43 Folders](<http://www.43folders.com/2007/12/11/why-
> are-you-reading-all-news>))

Read the whole article: it **challenges assumptions** about why we read (and
write) our blogs so diligently.
