Happy Valentines Day. As you can see, there is a new web site design. This one
was created by a designer in China. I just thought I wanted something a little
more professional. As for the software, there are several new developments. We
are diving into the questions of unread handling. This is leading to new
designs in several areas: there is now a BlogBridge Preferences dialog.
Included here will be settings allowing Articles to be automatically set to
unread under certain conditions. Also there will be some changes required in
the low level persistence handling to track unread.
