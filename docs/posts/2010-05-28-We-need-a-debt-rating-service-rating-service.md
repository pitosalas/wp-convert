Very meta. Who rates the rating services?

I saw this in the [Wall Street Journal, an article today called Stocks Wind
Down a Brutal
May:](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704596504575272002400905196.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLETopStories#printMode>)

And I thought, who is this [Fitch Ratings
Service](<http://www.fitchratings.com/index_fitchratings.cfm>), and can we
trust them? Hmm. Who can I ask? I need a Dept Rating Service Rating Service.
