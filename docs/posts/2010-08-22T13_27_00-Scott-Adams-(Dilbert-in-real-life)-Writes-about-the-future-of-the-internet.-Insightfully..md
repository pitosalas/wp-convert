> And that's your future of the Internet. The cost of content, such as this
> blog, and my comic strip, will continue to approach zero. The art will
> happen with the editing. Others have made the obvious point that editing
> will be important for the future of the Internet. All I'm adding is the
> notion that most editors have skill, but few are artists. The world of print
> publishing is driven by editors who are exceptionally skilled. But they
> aren't artists. Newser is edited by an artist. He or she isn't giving me
> information; he's adjusting my mood. That's art. That's the future. (
