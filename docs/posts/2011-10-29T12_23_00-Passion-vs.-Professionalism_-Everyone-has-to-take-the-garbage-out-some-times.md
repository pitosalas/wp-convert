Interesting article with a provocative title: "[The Designer's Notebook:
Passion Versus
Professionalism](<http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6523/the_designers_notebook_passion_.php?print=1>)".
This is a topic that interests me. He says:

> "Passion" is an excuse used by employers to mistreat their employees. Your
> passion is supposed to make up for the insane hours and low pay for which
> the industry is notorious. Many job ads emphasize the importance of passion
> in applicants; few emphasize the quality of life that the employer offers. (
> **from** Passion vs. Professionalism")

Reading the whole article, in the end I don't agree with his argument. I think
in general passion is a very important thing, and one should strive for it in
your chosen profession. Without it, with just professionalism, I think no
matter what your work is, it will become drudgery. I say "strive for it"
because it's true that no matter how much you love your job, some days you
will really despise it. And as my friend Pat used to say about an unpleasant
work assignment:  "Everyone has to take out the garbage some times"
