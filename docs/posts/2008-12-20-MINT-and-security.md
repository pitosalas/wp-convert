I have a new favorite web service: [Mint](<http://www.mint.com/>). It's a
really nice implementation of kind of a "Quicken" online, but with a few
unique wrinkles. Here's what it does:

  * Automatically and periodically downloads all the transactions from all your various accounts, banks, credit cards, etc.

  * Automatically categorizes the transactions based on the indicated vendors. This works about 80-90% of the time

  * Allows you to manually override the categorization if you know better (and it learns from that and applies it to other transactions.)

  * Automatically suggests a set of budget rules, which it then monitors for you. These are also fully customizable.

  * Generates useful pie charts and investment performance graphs, again automatically.

  * It's free.

Anyway that's just a small subset of the prominent features.
[Mint](<http://www.mint.com/>) is a nicely executed, fast enough Web 2.0
application. I am pretty impressed with it.

What it does not do is to allow you to initiate any transactions from Mint.
You can't withdraw, transfer, pay bills or anything like that.

Which brings me to everyone's first question: security. This is the scary
side. I have not yet decided how I feel about it.

During setup you are asked to supply the password to each of your financial
institutions (exactly what Quicken and Microsoft Money ask you to do. After
all, you assume that the passwords never leave Quicken's files on your
computer, but you don't really know that.) When I describe
[Mint](<http://www.mint.com/>) to people, many of them **freak out** at this
point.

Reading [Mint's extensive security FAQ](<http://www.mint.com/privacy/>), what
they say is that they don't store or remember any of that information. It's
just a pass through one of several third party services, unnamed, who then
have arrangements to download the information from your bank etc. So with
proper security measures, clever cryptographic signing and secret keys… maybe.

What's the exposure?

The [New York Times has an article about the security of Web based financial
sites](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/your-
money/20mint.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper>) today.

But unfortunately it just reports that people are facing this dilemma and not
what the real risks. Life Hacker had a nice article "[Is Mint Ready for Your
Money](<http://lifehacker.com/software/screenshot-tour/is-mint-ready-for-your-
money-312083.php>)" that you want to read.

It would be nice to have an actual security expert do an analysis of this.
[Bruce Schneier?](<http://www.schneier.com/blog/>) [David
Pogue](<http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/>)? How about it?
