**Link: [Lies people tell themselves](None):** ""

[Michael Arrington ](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington>)is a
famous Tech-pundit-commentator-blogger who recently left or got fired from AOL
because he wanted to be a VC while being a journalist covering the companies
he is investing in.

One way or another that led him and AOL and the super-popular blog he started,
[TechCrunch](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch>), to part ways. All
that is interesting back story.

Arrington recently wrote a very [provocative article arguing that people who
are serious entrepreneurs in serious startups, especially in Silicon Valley,
should be willing to give up their life for work:
](<http://uncrunched.com/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-more-cry-less-
and-quit-all-the-whining/>) Startups are hard. So work more, cry less, and
quit all the whining. Yes he is a genius provocateur.

> more-cry-less-and-quit-all-the-whining/>))

This is the usual drivel that is fed to innocents in startups and would hardly
be worth mentioning except that it got a huge reaction (both pro and con) in
the rarified tech geek startup ranks. If you read the article you notice that
Arrington quotes at length from a [Jamie Zawinski who captured his feelings in
a diary from 1994](<http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html>), for example:

> "I slept at work again last night; two and a half hours curled up in a quilt
> underneath my desk, from 11am to 1:30pm or so. That was when I woke up with
> a start, realizing that I was late for a meeting we were scheduled to have
> to argue about colormaps and dithering, and how we should deal with all the
> nefarious 8-bit color management issues. But it was no big deal, we just had
> the meeting later. It's hard for someone to hold it against you when you
> miss a meeting because you've been at work so long that you've passed out
> from exhaustion." (**from** [NSCP
> Dorm](<http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html>))

You get the idea. Well wouldn't you know, Jamie Zawinski for 2011 is not so
happy about being used to bolster Arrington's article. In "[Watch a VC use my
name to sell a con"](<http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-
to-sell-a-con/>) he writes:

> "Follow the fucking money. When a VC tells you what's good for you, check
> your wallet, then count your fingers. He's telling you the story of, "If you
> bust your ass and don't sleep, you'll get rich" because the only way that
> people in his line of work get richer is if young, poorly-socialized, naive
> geniuses believe that story! Without those coat-tails to ride, VCs might
> have to work for a living. Once that kid burns out, they'll just slot a new
> one in." (**from** [Jamie Zawinski)](<http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-
> a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con/>)

You might gather that in this case I am more in Zawinski's camp.
