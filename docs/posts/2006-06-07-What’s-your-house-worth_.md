If you haven't seen this, it's kind of cool. [Zillow](<http://www.zillow.com>)
is a web site that take an address - maybe your **home address** , maybe your
boss's, maybe your **arch** enemy's - and shows you a lot of information about
the property, especially an estimate of it's current market value and how it's
changed. **Cool**.  <!-
