>> If you haven't seen this, it's kind of cool.
[Zillow](<http://www.zillow.com>) is a web site that take an address - maybe
your **home address** , maybe your boss's, maybe your **arch** enemy's - and
shows you a lot of information about the property, especially an estimate of
it's current market value and how it's changed. **Cool**.
