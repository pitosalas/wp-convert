[Enterprise 2.0](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_2.0>) is one of
those terms that is being bandied about by various people. In the [Portals and
KM Blog, Bill Ives](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/>) has written
a couple interesting run downs of what's going on in that world.

In ["Description and Reviews of Enterprise 2.0
Tools"](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/2007/09/descriptions-
an.html>), there's a good summary of some of the new open source and
commercial tools and services that support Enterprise 2.0.
[Awareness](<http://www.awarenessnetworks.com/home/>) is especially
impressive, and one that I know well, as I've been working with them for the
last 6 months or so.

In ["Growing Collection of Enterprise 2.0 Success
Stories",](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/2007/09/growing-
collect.html>) there's a great list of actual case studies of deployment and
implementation of Enterprise 2.0 projects in diverse organizations.

if you are interested in [tag]Enterprise 2.0[/tag] these are good reads.
