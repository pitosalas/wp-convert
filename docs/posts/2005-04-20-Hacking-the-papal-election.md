I have to admit to being **fascinated** with the Vatican, and the **ancient**
, elaborate **traditions** and **rules** that surround the papacy.  Bruce
Schneier, in his (**excellent**) monthly newsletter had a [really interesting
discussion](<http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0504.html#8>) about the rules
and procedures that have been set down (and fairly **recently** updated) for
the papal election:

>>

>>> "As the College of Cardinals prepares to elect a new pope, people like me
wonder about the election process. How does it work, and just how hard is it
to hack the vote?" (from [Crypto-Gram](<http://www.schneier.com/crypto-
gram-0504.html#8>))

>>

>> Did you realize that the Vatican publishes the complete election rules
online? It is quite interesting, if nothing else, to see how detailed they
are, and that they are in (the Pope's) first person:

>>

>>> "After careful reflection I have therefore decided that the only form by
which the electors can manifest their vote in the election of the Roman
Pontiff is by secret ballot, in accordance with the rules set forth below.
This form offers the greatest guarantee of clarity, straightforwardness,
simplicity, openness and, above all, an effective and fruitful participation
on the part of the Cardinals who, individually and as a group, are called to
make up the assembly which elects the Successor of Peter." (from [UNIVERSI
DOMINICI
GREGIS](<http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-
