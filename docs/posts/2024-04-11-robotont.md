**Link: [robotont](http://robotont.ut.ee/main?lang=en):** "What is Robotont?     Robotont is open-source platform for robotics education and research. It is an omnidirectional mobile robot with ROS (Robot Operating System) support. Development of robotont is coordinated by the Institute of Technology, University of Tartu."

And yet another open source ROS robot kit from another university. It seems that everyone is designing a new robot model for their purposes. I wonder whether it's worth our while to be doing our own as well at Brandeis.
