Look for our [BlogBridge Release 5.0](<http://www.blogbridge.com>) in the next
several days. You will get automatically updated, so just sit back and enjoy
it. When we actually release it we will also post to this blog with some
pointers to the highlights of the new release.

Also, I will be attending [O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference (aka
"ETECH") ](<http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/>) in San Diego (USA) next
week and will be getting together a meetup or BOF of
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>) users and others with an interest.
If you want to join me in San Diego, please send me an
[email](<mailto:support@blogbridge.com>), and I will get in touch with the
where and when.
