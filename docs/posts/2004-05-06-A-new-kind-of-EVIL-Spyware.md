title: "A new kind of EVIL Spyware"

One of my computers has gone totally haywire with spyware, popups popping all
over the place, and more. Here's the new spin, which I hadn't seen before.

>>

>> When surfing the web, arbitrary words on web pages are turned into links,
and when you innocently click them, you are sent off the deep end with ads,
popups, software installing itself or claiming to do so. It's really ugly. I
had never seen that before.

>>

>> Anyway, my usual medicine for thar problem was [Ad-
Aware](<http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/>). It's free, and it has
been very effective in the past. In this case, it didn't successfully clean
the machine. In fact it seemed to have no noticable effect!

>>

>> I checked Download.com, where an app called [Spy
Sweeper](<http://www.webroot.com/wb/products/spysweeper/index.php>) was said
to have been the PC Magazine Editors Choice. I ran that and it was far more
successful. At least with the regular spyware. The word highlighting one is
still there. More later.
