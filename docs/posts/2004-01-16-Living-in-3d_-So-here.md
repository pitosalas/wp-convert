# [Living in 3d? So here](None)

>> **Living in 3d?** So [here are these really cool 3D Mars
Pictures](<http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040115a/2R127428271FFL0300P1004A0M2_str1-A12R1.jpg>).
But my question is, where do I get the specs? I saw [these freebie 3D
glasses](<http://www.rainbowsymphony.com/freestuff.html>), but who knows if
they are the right kind. I will report further if I find out. Faithful
readership, please let me know?
