The New York Times is [running a
series](<http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/sciencespecial2/index.html>) on
the Evolution/Intelligent Design 'debate'. Quite interesting. I was startled
to see this in the article, though: Referring to the Discovery Institute, one
of the main think tanks pushing the ID agenda, the New York Times says:

>>

>>> "A closer look shows a multidimensional organization, financed by
missionary and mainstream groups - the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
provides $1 million a year, including $50,000 of Mr. Chapman's $141,000 annual
salary - and asserting itself on questions on issues as varied as local
transportation and foreign affairs." (**from** "Politicized Scholars Put
Evolution on the Defensive", [New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/national/21evolve.html?ei=5090&en=24bc1c93150ac8a8&ex=1282276800&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all>))

>>

>> The New York Times series is just beginning (2 articles so far) and seems
to be a good survey of the issue.
