Unless you have been living under a **rock** (or have **better** things to do
with your time) you will have seen [Google Maps](<http://maps.google.com>).
Well, I only just tonight looked at them for the first time.  **Stunning!** A
spectacular web application. Highly usable and useful. And easy on the eyes!
Here's a [really good quick introduction to Google Maps from Peter Merholz's
blog. ](<http://www.peterme.com/archives/000454.html>). You'll find some
screenshots illustrating key features, and some user interface commentary. And
here's [a link to google maps themselves](<http://maps.google.com>). **Check
it out!**
