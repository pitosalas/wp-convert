**Link: [[EDUCATION] Crowd Sourcing your Strategy](None):** ""



The other day I referenced an [article questioning the motivation and
effectiveness of large scale strategic planning exercises in universities
today.](</imported-20111103233638/2012/5/4/education-strategic-plans-are-they-
worth-the-paper-they-are.html>)

In this vein I was interested to see this [article describing how certain
organizations have totally thrown open the process of developing and
communicating
strategy](<https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Strategy/Strategy_in_Practice/The_social_side_of_strategy_2965>)
by employing some good old crowd sourcing.

> "In 2009, Wikimedia1 launched a special wiki—one dedicated to the
> organization’s own strategy. Over the next two years, more than 1,000
> volunteers generated some 900 proposals for the company’s future direction
> and then categorized, rationalized, and formed task forces to elaborate on
> them.
>
> The result was a coherent strategic plan detailing a set of beliefs,
> priorities, and related commitments that together engendered among
> participants a deep sense of dedication to Wikimedia’s future.
>
> Through the launch of several special projects and the continued work of
> self-organizing teams dedicated to specific proposals, the vision laid out
> in the strategic plan is now unfolding." ( **from** [The Social Side of
