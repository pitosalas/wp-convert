**Link: [Americans Elect: Another Opinion](None):** ""

A month or two ago I read an [article by Thomas Friedman introducing Americans
Elect,](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/opinion/sunday/24friedman.html?_r=1>)
an innovative concept for bringing a third major presidential candidate to the
table for this year's Presidential contest. I liked it so much I wrote about
in on my blog.

So it is with great interest that I came across this recent article by [Gail
Collins totally hating the Americans Elect
concept](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/opinion/collins-time-to-elect-the-
worst-idea.html?_r=1>):

Wow. I admit that a little while ago I started having misgivings about
Americans Elect. The reason was that I could see no candidates there that I
knew or liked. And those that were doing well seemed very conservative. It got
me wondering whether I had been tricked into donating my $25 to Republican or
Tea Party front. I have no evidence of that, but for sure my enthusiasm has
dropped quite a bit.
