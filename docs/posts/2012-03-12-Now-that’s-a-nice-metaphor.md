I love this metaphor - or is it a simile - or a malapropism - who knows:

> "It’s the cloud within the sterling silver lining" - [Frank Bruni in the New
> York Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/bruni-mitts-
> rich-predicament.html>)

See what he did there? It's inside out and upside down. Cool. Forgive me, [the
article is ok too,](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/bruni-
mitts-rich-predicament.html>) but that quote jumped out at me I had to spin up
the ole blog machine.


[Now that’s a nice metaphor](None)
