>> **IMHO:** I **started and stopped** writing this two days ago, mostly
because I didn't feel like I knew any of the people or issues involved well
enough to have the right to a meaningful opinion, not to mention that I would
be seens as **sucking up** (people are so quick to **judge - **but what the
hell, here goes…)

>> But I just feel like I must post a brief note of **support and agreement**
with what [Doc](<http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/02/06#peaceOut>) and
[Jon](<http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/02/06.html#a911>) wrote about
the recent bit of mean-spirited writing about RSS and its history, both on
public blogs and private newsgroups. I wasn't there but [Dave
Winer](<http://www.scripting.com>) was and I am willing to [take him at his
word](<http://archive.scripting.com/2004/02/05#When:1:30:34PM>). But you know
what, I think that's ancient history. **So for the record** : theres no doubt
in my mind that Dave deserves **credit** and **respect** for the totally
central role he played and continues to play in the blog phenomenon. Count me
as a fan.

wrote](<http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/02/06#peaceOut>): "There's so much left to
do. Let's stop making it harder than it already is." **Life is too short.**
