# [Check out Doc Searls Suitwatch newsletter](None)



>>

>> There are a few **really good** newsletters that have not moved over to a
blog which I read religiously. One of them is [Doc
Searls](<http://doc.weblogs.com/>)' Suitwatch. Doc writes a fairly long essay
approximately monthly. It's **always interesting** and **well written**.
Here's how his most [recent
episode](<http://lists.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2006-February.txt>), about
CES in Las Vegas, begins:

>>

>>> "What could be more ridiculous than a city that wants to be like
everywhere else? Venice, Paris, New York, Rome and Monte Carlo are all in Las
Vegas, embodied as giant hotels, each as cliched as a travel brochure. Nearly
all the big theme hotels front The Strip, a wide paved line in a desert no
less arid than the hundred empty basins between the hundred stony ranges that
comprise the rest of Nevada." ( **From** ["The Produced Electronics
Revolution, Part
I"](<http://lists.ssc.com/pipermail/suitwatch/2006-February.txt>))

>>

>> You should consider [subscribing to
this](<http://lists.ssc.com/mailman/listinfo/suitwatch>). It's always a **good
read**. It just shows that the form (blog or newsletter or whatever) doesn't
matter if the content is great!
