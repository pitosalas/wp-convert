**Link: [[ETECH] Taxonomy of Folksonomies](None):** ""

There's been a lot of talk about tags, folksonomies, taxonomies, etc. Trying
to make sense out of this can be confusing. At the recent ETech conference
there was more than one presentation on the topic, each of which helped me
understand the subtleties a little better, and organize them in my mind.

into this topic it will probably be somewhat obscure and likely not very
interesting, so you are warned!]_

>> What are we to do with this term **' Tags'?** It is used in many different
places, sometimes to mean the same thing and **sometimes something subtly
different**. This is not surprising about a set of ideas that are morphing
right in front of our eyes and ears. So let's look at some examples and
compare them.

>> Let's look at tags in Flickr and tags in Del.icio.us (if you don't know one
or the other, you owe it to yourself to look into them.)

>>

>> Both have tags, but they are different in a subtle way:

>>

>> In Flickr I am tagging **my own stuff** (pictures that I've uploaded)
mostly **for other people** to find.

>>

>> In Del.icio.us I am tagging mostly **other people 's stuff** (links to web
pages) for **my own benefit** , that is organizing links of interest to me.

>> One way to organize a taxonomy of folksonomies is to notice that there are
two dimensions: Whose stuff is being tagged, and for whose benefit. Flickr
ends up in the bottom right, and del.icio.us in the top left. But what about
the other quadrants?

>>

>> This organization gives a **new way** of looking at conventional concepts
like folders and directories on personal computers ( _my stuff/my own
benefits_ ) and Web based directories like Yahoo ( _other people 's
stuff/other people's benefit._)
