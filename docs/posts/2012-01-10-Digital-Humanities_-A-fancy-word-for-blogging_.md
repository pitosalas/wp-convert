Here's an interesting [article in "The Opinionator" of the New York Times
about blogging, scholarly writing and the tension between the
two.](<http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-
and-the-transcending-of-mortality/>) He says:

> "… The digital humanities, it is claimed, can help alter that âmonstrous
> terrainâ in at least two ways. The first is to open up the conversation to
> the public whose support the traditional humanities has lost. If anyone and
> everyone can join in, if the invitation of open access is widely accepted,
> appreciation of what humanists do will grow beyond the confines of the
> university. Familiarity will breed not contempt, but fellowship. âOnly in
> this way,â Fitzpatrick declares, âcan we ensure the continued support
> for the university not simply as a credentialing center, but rather as a
> center of thought." (from **[The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of
> Mortality)](<http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-
> humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/>)**

Interesting article, although itself a bit of a **scholarly** blog. After all
he uses the word "[teleological](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology>)" in
a sentence, which I admit having to look up 🙂

> "There are two things I want to say about this vision: first, that it is
> [theological](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology>), a description its
> adherents would most likely resist, and, second, that it is political, a
> description its adherents would most likely embrace." (from **[The Digital
> Humanities and the Transcending of
> Mortality)](<http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-
> humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/>)**
