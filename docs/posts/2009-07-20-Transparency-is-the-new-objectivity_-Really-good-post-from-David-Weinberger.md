Man, this is a a subtle area. but fascinating.

Over the years I've been convinced by David, (even though he wasn't trying to
convince me) by the idea that there are precious few (if any) 'facts' that are
just simply 'true'. Maybe that's an observation about the world, maybe about
how we think, or maybe about language, I don't know. But for any 'fact',
almost, I often can produce a counter example.

My current obsession is **Voting Reform** , and so I've thought a lot about
how we cast votes on ballots and then how they are counted. You might think
that given a particular ballot or box of ballots, asking "how many votes did
candidate X get" is a factual question to which there is an answer. Not so.

To see why I say this, check out my [post about the 'true' result of an
election.](</2009/06/16/what-is-the-true-result-of-an-election/>)

[David Weinberger's](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weinberger>) post
[Transparency is the new
Objectivity](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2009/07/19/transparency-is-the-
new-objectivity/>) tells a fascinating part of the story; you should read it.
