>> I came [across a cool series of podcasts](<http://www.adamgreen.org/>),
done by **Adam Green** , on the history of the personal computer software
industry. Actually Adam told me about them 🙂 You can find them
[here](<http://www.adamgreen.org/>) as well as directly under the [iTunes
podcast
section](<http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=97303498&s=143441>).

>>

>> I just listened to the first episode, about software naming with some good
stories about how [Visicalc](<http://www.bricklin.com/visicalc.htm>) was named
and the fact that [Ashton-Tate](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton-Tate>)
was not named after a parrot called Ashton, and of course that [Jeff
Tarter](<https://sf1000.registeredsite.com/~user989239/workshop.html>) is
**not** retired.

>> _p.s. Adam has a really_ _[interesting blog called"Darwinian Web"
](<http://darwinianweb.com/>)__Also follow his_ _[escapades with
Ruby](<http://ruby.darwinianweb.com/>)_
