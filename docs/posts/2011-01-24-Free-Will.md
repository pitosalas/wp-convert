This is from a really difficult article called[ "How Can I Possibly Be Free?"
in the New Atlantis](<http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/how-can-i-
possibly-be-free>). At least it was really difficult for me to really
appreciate the nuance of the argument. So it's not a matter of agreeing or
not, but it is a fascinating read. I recommend it (if you are into that kind
of thing ðŸ™‚

p.s. [The New Atlantis](<http://www.thenewatlantis.com/>) is an online
magazine that I recently stumbled across. I have learned a lot from some of
the articles (like this one ["Getting Over the Code
Delusion"](<http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/getting-over-the-code-
delusion>))
