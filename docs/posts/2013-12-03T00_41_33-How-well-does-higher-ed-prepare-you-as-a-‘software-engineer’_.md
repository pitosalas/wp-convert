This article is a bit harsh/one-sided, but I still thought it was interesting
to see an attempt at comparing programming as practiced in two very different
contexts.

[What's the difference between college-level and corporate programming? | Ars
Technica](<http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/whats-the-
difference-between-college-level-and-corporate-programming/>):

In a vaguely related article, think about this: In the modern economy/society,
is learning to 'code' a fundamental piece of a good education? This article
makes a good case that it is not:

Poor](<http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/12/stop-thinking-that-coding-is-the-
answer-to-all-of-societys-problems/>)
