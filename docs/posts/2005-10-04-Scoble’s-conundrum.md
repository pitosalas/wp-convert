title: "Scoble’s conundrum"

His conundrum is that he loves both Web services (browser based applications)
and Windows applications and can't seem to pick a one-size-fits-all
preference. Apparently some of his readers noticed that and are calling him to
task on it.

certainly is a possibility that I'm drinking the Redmond Koolaid," (**from**

>> Read Scoble's whole post, it has a very good perspective, and actually I
**totally agree** with the dilemma. Maybe it's **not** a dilemma at all. Maybe
it's not being religious and just picking the best tool for the job, balancing
all factors relevant to you. Whether it's Windows or Web is one of many
characteristics, and not at all the most important one. I wrote about this
recently over on the [BlogBridge
blog](<http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2005/09/downloadable_ap.php>):

comparing it with
[Robert's](<http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/10/04.html#a11363>) you see
some similar and some different reasons cited, but the overall sentiment and
conclusion to be the same. Hey
[Robert](<http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/10/04.html#a11363>), forget
about the **Redmond Koolaid** , that too is just **one factor**.  It's been a
**while** since you checked out [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com/>) and
there are a lot of new ideas we are trying out there which would be perfect
for a user like you: direct del.icio.us integration, SmartFeeds (like Outlook
Smart Folders), collaborative filtering, intelligent sorting and sub-setting,
and on and on. [Check it

yet, let me give you a demo! Technorati Tags:
