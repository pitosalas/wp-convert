mobile and game development](<https://sites.google.com/site/jbs2011mobile/>).
So I follow stories about how to more easily create cross platform mobile apps
with great interest. Check this post [Adobe Software Updates To Help Devs

[TechCrunch](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch>):

> Adobe is today pushing updates to its application development software
> product Flash Builder and the open source Flex framework to enable
> developers to build apps for iPhone, iPad and BlackBerry PlayBook, following
> support for the Android platform (added last April).
