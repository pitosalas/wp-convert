Have you ever heard a politician or pundit say, with self-assurance, America
is a **Right of Center** country. Think [Newt
Gingrich.](<http://www.newt.org/>)

Right of Center. **How** do we **determine** the center?

Isn't this a lot like [Lake Wobegon](<http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/>),
"Where **all** our children are **above average** "?

I'm just sayin'…
