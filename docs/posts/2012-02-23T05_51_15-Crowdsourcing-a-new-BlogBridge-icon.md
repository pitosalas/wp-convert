Well, it's been about 5 years with the same (lovely) BlogBridge application
icon and as we are redesigning the web site and releasing a major new release
of the product, we thought, hey, it's time to update the icon to something,
ahem, a little more modern.

In case you forgot (or never knew),here's what the BlogBridge app icon looks
like today:

I guess, nice, but boring, yes?

So what I am looking for is a beautiful new, 3D rendered, and meaningful
application icon. Something that will look really cool in my dock (but equally
on a Windows or Linux desktop.)

So far I've considered using:

  * [99designs.com](<https://99designs.com/>)
  * [crowdspring.com](<https://www.crowdspring.com>)
  * [vworker.com](<http://www.vworker.com/>) (used to be rent-a-coder)
  * [guru.com](<http://www.guru.com/>)
  * [freelancer.com](<http://www.freelancer.com/>)

So far I am liking **99designs.com** the best. But if you have suggestions,
please send them to me!
