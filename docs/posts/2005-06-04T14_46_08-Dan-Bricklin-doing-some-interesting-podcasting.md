>> I just came off listening to [Dan Bricklin's first podcast, an interview
with Linda
Hamel](<http://www.softwaregarden.com/podcast/dbsl.html#dbsl-2005-04-18-19-55-16>)
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts about **patents** , **intellectual
property and open source.** Quite interesting info. I am looking forward to
listening [to the other
ones.](<http://www.softwaregarden.com/podcast/dbsl.html>)

>> One link, right off the bat is to [Linda Hamel's own web
site](<http://www.mass.gov/portal/index.jsp?pageID=itdsubtopic&L=3&L0=Home&L1=Policies%2c+Standards+%26+Legal&L2=Open+Standards&sid=Aitd>)
with lots of interesting resources about Open Source licensing in the public
arena.

>> Particularly cool is[ this huge Excel chart doing a comparison of all the
multitude of open source
licenses.](<http://www.mass.gov/Aitd/docs/quickrefchart.xls>)
