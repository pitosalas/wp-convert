**Link: [[JAVA ONE]Sun answers my question](None):** ""

In [several ](</weblogs/archives/000449.html>)previous [posts
](</weblogs/archives/000446.html>)I've wondered aloud: "I can see that Sun
spends a ton of money on Java. It must be astronomical. What's the strategy
behind that? How do they make money on that?"

>>

>> Jonathan Schwartz, Sun's President and COO, [answers that question directly
in his new Blog.](<http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040712>)

>>

>> And in the **" you can't win"** department: One of my observations about
this year's Java One was that there was a real contrast between the way Java
ran this and the way, for example, Microsoft runs the PDC (Professional
Developers Conference.) Microsoft works hard at and I think succeeds at
painting a grand future for their stuff. Not only what is here today, but what
will be coming in 12 months, 3 years, 5 years and even 10 years. A holistic
and compelling vision.

>>

>> In contrast, at Java One, I felt Sun basically appologetic: "No, Java
_really is_ fast" and "See, _it is possible_ to write real time applications
in Java" and, "_Who said_ you can't make great desktop apps in Java?".

>>

>> And with this posting, Jonathan Schwartz **continues this appologia** :
"No, stop complaining: we do have an idea of how we make money on Java. Just
like GE made money on standard rails, [and other parallel examples]"

>>

>> I am not sure that the economics argument works (over my head) but I am
sure that it **doesn 't bristle with confidence and passion**.
