>> For those of you who came, thanks for joining us. For those of you who
didn't come, you missed out! I think we had about 30 people (but didn't count)
and I met many new people which was great. It seems like these Geek Dinners
are popping up all over, and makes us East Coast geeks feel like we actually
exist!

>> Thanks to my co-organizers [Adam Green](<http://www.darwinianweb.com/>) and
Mark Doerschlag, RSS Labs, [Bela
Labovitch](<http://blogs.opml.org/BelaLabovitch>) and Indigo Tabor for
pitching in!
