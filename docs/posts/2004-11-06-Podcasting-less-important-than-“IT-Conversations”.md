I was working out, listening an [IT Conversations
](<http://www.itconversations.com/>)interview with [Joel
Spolsky](<http://www.joelonsoftware.com/>). It was **interesting** and passed
the time.

>> It's **wonderful** that [Doug Kaye](<http://www.rds.com/doug/resume.html>)
interviewed [Joel Spolsky](<http://www.joelonsoftware.com/>), and it's
wonderful that Joel was fun to listen to, it was wonderful that this MP3 was
available on the internet, and that I had iPodder to automatically download it
to me iPod, and of course, my iPod is wonderful.

>>

>> **But I realized this:** [I had been doing this "by hand"
](</weblogs/archives/000496.html>)before Podcasting or iPodder existed. The
far bigger deal then and now is that IT Conversations are making these great
recordings and making them available to me. [Podcasting is just a neat new
distribution medium.](</weblogs/archives/000506.html>)

>>

>> For all the talk and [excitement around
podcasting](<http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/11/06#remakingRadio>), there should
have been at **least as much** devoted to sites like IT Conversation, which as
far as I know is the **only one of its kind.**
