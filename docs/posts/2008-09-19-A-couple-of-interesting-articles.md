A very interesting article in Edge.org (by the way, an always interesting
site.) This one is called [Moral Psychology and the misunderstanding of
religion:](<http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/haidt07/haidt07_index.html>)

> "I study morality from every angle I can find. Morality is one of those
> basic aspects of humanity, like sexuality and eating, that can't fit into
> one or two academic fields. I think morality is unique, however, in having a
> kind of spell that disguises it. We all care about morality so passionately
> that it's hard to look straight at it. We all look at the world through some
> kind of moral lens, and because most of the academic community uses the same
> lens, we validate each other's visions and distortions. I think this problem
> is particularly acute in some of the new scientific writing about religion.

And a totally different, yet equally interesting article: "Smart Taxes: An
Open Invitation to join the Pigou club". Among other things, you learn in this
article what [Pigovian taxes
are](<http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/09/pigovian-slippery-slope.html>):

> "My topic for today is a policy about which there is a particularly large
> gap between economists and the public: Pigovian taxation.   In particular, I
> want to talk about taxes on energy-related products, such as gasoline taxes.
>
> Not long ago, the economist Steve Levitt, coauthor of the best-seller
> Freakonomics, wrote on his blog, “For a long time I have felt the price of
> gasoline in the United States was way too low. Pretty much  
> all economists believe this.”  Levitt then went on to argue for higher taxes
> on gasoline.
>
> At about the same time, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had precisely the
> opposite perspective.  She announced “a series of hearings to address rising
> gas prices—focusing on the causes, the burdens they put on American families
> and businesses, and solutions.” (from ["Smart Taxes: An Open Invitation to
> join the Pigou
> club](<http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/Smart%20Taxes.pdf>)")
