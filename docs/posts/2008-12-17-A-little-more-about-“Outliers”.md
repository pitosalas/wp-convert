**Link: [A little more about “Outliers”](None):** ""



Since I wrote a [somewhat negative post mentioning Outliers and Malcolm
Gladwell](</2008/12/07/joel-on-software-talks-about-malcolm-gladwell-and-tom-
friedman/>) the other day, I thought this was a worthwhile follow-up,[ "Lost
in the Crowd" from the New York
Times,](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/opinion/16brooks.html?partner=rss&emc=rss>)
which starts sounding positive:

> "As usual, Gladwell intelligently captures a larger tendency of thought —
> the growing appreciation of the power of cultural patterns, social
> contagions, memes. His book is being received by reviewers as a call to
> action for the Obama age. It could lead policy makers to finally reject
> policies built on the assumption that people are coldly rational utility-
> maximizing individuals. It could cause them to focus more on policies that
> foster relationships, social bonds and cultures of achievement." (from NYT,
> "[Lost in the
> Crowd](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/opinion/16brooks.html?partner=rss&emc=rss>)")

But in the end, I am not so sure:

> "Gladwell’s social determinism is a useful corrective to the Homo economicus
> view of human nature. It’s also pleasantly egalitarian. The less successful
> are not less worthy, they’re just less lucky. But it slights the centrality
> of individual character and individual creativity. And it doesn’t fully
> explain the genuine greatness of humanity’s outliers. As the classical
> philosophers understood, examples of individual greatness inspire
> achievement more reliably than any other form of education. If Gladwell can
> reduce William Shakespeare to a mere product of social forces, I’ll buy 25
> more copies of “Outliers” and give them away in Times Square." (from NYT,
> "[Lost in the
> Crowd](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/opinion/16brooks.html?partner=rss&emc=rss>)")
