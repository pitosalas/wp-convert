Who would think that our advanced space fairing craft have a YERO (Year End
Rollover) problem?

From an [article about the YERO
problem:](<http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026>)

> "The YERO problem relates to the shuttle orbiter's computers needing to

I've been reading more about the pre-Shuttle space program. One factoid which
is almost hard to believe was that the computers on the Apollo had the power
of a modern day digital watch. I bet they didn't have a YERO problem 🙂
