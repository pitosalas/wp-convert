This trend is now unstoppable - massive open online courses - or MOOCs - are
constantly in the news. The angle often seems to be about whether or how or
how much they will impact higher education and education in general. It's a
topic I am very interested in.

[Here's another piece of the puzzle, this time from the New York Times. In
this article a reporter signs up for ten different online courses in a quest
to assess from his personal experience along these
dimensions:](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/opinion/sunday/grading-the-
mooc-university.html?pagewanted=3&ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all>)

  * Professors: B+
  * Convenience: A
  * Teacher to student interaction: D
  * Student to student interaction: B-
  * Assignments: B-
  * Overall experience: B

His telling comments about the convenience factor:

> "Regardless of the convenience, you still have to carve out time for the
> lectures. Which is one reason the dropout rate for MOOCs is notoriously
> high: Coursera’s bioelectricity course, taught by a Duke professor, saw an
> astounding 97 percent of students fail to finish. My dropout rate was lower,
> but only a bit. I signed up for 11 courses, and finished 2: “Introduction to
> Philosophy” and “The Modern World: Global History since 1760.” (Well, to be
> honest, I’m not quite done with history — I’m still stuck in the 1980s.) Not
> coincidentally, these were two courses with lighter workloads and less
> jargon." ( **from** NYT: [Grading the MOOC
