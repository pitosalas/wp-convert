One more in the category of 'you can find everything on the internet' check
out this ["falling woman"](<http://xoxma.com.ua/img/flash/00001.swf>) flash
animation. Watch the woman fall. When she stops falling, use your mouse to
drag her to another place, and away she goes. (No it's not as creepy as that
description makes it sound)!
