Just an amusing little bit from the Wall Street Journal about the Toyota
Prius:

>>

>>> "Some buyers of **Toyota Motor** Corp.'s Prius gas-electric hybrid cars
are complaining that their vehicles are stalling or shutting down at highway-
driving speeds, a problem Toyota attributes to software problems in the
sophisticated computer system." ([from
WSJ](<http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB111619464176634063,00.html>),

>> And also:

>>

>>> In one complaint, a driver told NHTSA that the car shut down while driving
at 60 miles an hour. The Prius continued to lose power as the driver pressed
the accelerator. The car had to be towed back to the dealership for repairs.

>>

>> Heaven help us! A whole new meaning to **mission critical** software!
