Interesting. There are more and more of these coming out. For now I doubt they work very well, in practice. However the trend is clear and they will get better and better. Are our jobs at risk? Only if we donâ€™t learn how to use these tools to up our game. A graphic designer or photographer that decided to resist learning Photoshop  and opposed its use in their profession is probably out of work now.
