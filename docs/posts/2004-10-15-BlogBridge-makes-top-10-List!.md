**Link: [BlogBridge makes top 10 List!](None):** ""

Hey, this is **really cool**. BlogBridge made a ["Top 10 Java Web Start
Apps"](<http://jroller.com/page/cardsharp/20041006#top_10_java_web_start>)
list. I ran across it on ["Cardsharp on
Software"](<http://jroller.com/page/cardsharp/Weblog?catname=/Java>), a blog
written by Kurt Williams.

>>

>> "7\. BlogBridge. **Wicked cool** RSS Client"

>> That alone led to **lots of downloads** and hits on the site. And then it
got picked up by [Java Desktop](<http://community.java.net/javadesktop/>) as a
**Featured Blog** , which led to even more traction.

>> **Wicked cool** , as they say!
