Check out [Arduino](<http://www.arduino.cc/>), a totally cool tiny embedded
computer suitable for creating smart things - art, robotics, sensors and
controllers. You program it on your laptop, and download the program to the
device. I tried it, it was pretty easy. Had to touch wires and stuff though 🙂

It appears to be a [vibrant
community](<http://groups.google.com/group/DorkbotBoston?hl=en>) with lots of
people building compatible boards as well as add-ons which they seem to call
"Shields". For example here's a [shield to allow wireless communication
between two Arduinos](<http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoXbeeShield>).

If you want to learn more, check out books called "[Physical
Computing"](<https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-
keywords=physical+computing&x=0&y=0>) and "[Making things
Talk"](<https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-
