By now if you probably heard about Cuil, the new search engine that claims to
be the biggest (since when does size matter when it comes to search engines?)
And secondly is being given a [PR pass because it was created by 'ex-Google
employees'](<http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/27/cuill-launches-a-massive-
search-engine/>) - I guess that's a major element for success?

Anyway, after doing my obvious test searches, like
[Curacao](<http://www.cuil.com/search?q=curacao&sl=long>), [Arlington
Mass](<http://www.cuil.com/search?q=arlington+massachusetts>), and
[BlogBridge](<http://www.cuil.com/search?q=blogbridge>), I thought I would try
each against an actual useful search I had been doing over the weekend:

### ****ipod cradle wireless sync****

See the results for yourself: [Google
results](<http://www.google.com/search?q=ipod+cradle+wireless+sync&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a>) and [Cuil
Results](<http://www.cuil.com/search?q=ipod+cradle+wireless+sync>).

Anyway it's just one test, but for me the Cuil results for the ipod cradle
[produced no results at all!

Give everyone the benefit of the doubt though:

  * Why are people making a [fuss about the fact that it was down on day one?](<http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/28/andcuil-is-down/>)

  * I will check my [test search again](<http://www.cuil.com/search?q=ipod+cradle+wireless+sync>) in coming days because it easily good be a transient condition


[Cuil vs. Google](None)
