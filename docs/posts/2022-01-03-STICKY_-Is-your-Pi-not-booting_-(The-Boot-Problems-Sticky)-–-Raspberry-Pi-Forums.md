[ STICKY: Is your Pi not booting? (The Boot Problems Sticky) - Raspberry Pi
Forums](<https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=58151>)

If you are reading this, you are presumably having trouble getting your
Raspberry Pi or Pi 2, PI3(+) or PI4B to boot. This post will talk you through
the potential causes of your boot problems, and will offer some solutions. If
you use the PI3B+, note that it will only boot past the "rainbow screen" if
you feed it the right (latest) boot files. So in case of trouble try using the
latest Raspbian from the download page, or try updating your older software on
an earlier PI on which it boots, with Raspbian that should work. If not ask
the people behind the software for a compatible version.
