Interesting story…

> "My summer internship was full of many positive experiences. I won’t forget,

> strange pride I felt when the only woman on our bowling team hit a strike,
> putting her ahead of some of our male colleagues — even though we were on
> the same team, mind you! It will take years for the fealing of outsider-ness
> to fade. And I count this experience as one more step towards educating
> myself, a part of the millenial generation, that a lot needs to change in
> our time at the helm."
