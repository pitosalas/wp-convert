BloggerCon IV is going on right now, in California. This is Dave Winer's
original '[UnConference](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference>)'. It's
being incredibly well covered, by blog, photo and podcast. I haven't come
close to reading all the stuff being posted, so these are just some semi-
random posts to give you a flavor:
