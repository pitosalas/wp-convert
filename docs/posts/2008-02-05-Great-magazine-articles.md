I was going to wait until I had read each of these great articles that all won
the ["Sidney
Awards"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/25/opinion/25brooks.html?_r=1&ref=opinion&oref=slogin>
"great magazine publishing") but this post was getting stale. And then [part
two of the Sidney
awards](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28brooks.html?_r=1&ref=opinion&oref=slogin>)
article came out, and I still hadn't published this. So, enough already.

If you appreciate really excellent non fiction writing, you owe it to yourself
to read some of these. All the ones I've read so far, about topics I didn't
know I would find interesting, have been excellent.
