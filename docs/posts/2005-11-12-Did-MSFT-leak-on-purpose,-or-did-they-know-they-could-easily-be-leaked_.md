**Link: [Did MSFT leak on purpose, or did they know they could easily be leaked?](None):** ""

I've read several accounts relating to Microsoft's recently 'leaked' documents
about the new strategy, for example, [Cringely
says](<http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051110.html>):

>>

>>> "While ostensibly written solely for internal discussion, the documents
from Bill Gates and new Microsoft CTO Ray Ozzie were clearly supposed to be
leaked." … and … "These are external marketing documents -- the equivalent of
those ubiquitous white papers …" (**via** [Scripting
News](<http://www.scripting.com/2005/11/12.html#When:11:42:38PM>))

>> I have a couple of thoughts on this:

>>

>>   1. "On Purpose" is relative: Any email that is sent to tens of thousands
of people is essentially certain to be leaked.

>>   2. Any experienced emailer knows that just about any message might get
leaked, and writes many if not most messages with that in mind.

>>   3. When you write anything that will be read by tens of thousands of
people, of course you copy edit it, of course you review it, of course you
write it carefully. That's not evidence of any kind of evil intent, it's just
rational

>>

Oh, and do I have any substantial thoughts about the content itself? Sure, why
not:

>>

>>   1. Microsoft and the press like comparing these recent memos to the
famous Halloween memos from years ago when Microsoft 'turned on a dime' and
embraced the Internet. I don't buy it. That was a long time ago, a much
different Microsoft, a different Bill Gates.

>>   2. I will wait to see it before I believe it. This is classic repackaging
of old stuff, making many beautiful architectural drawings to distract the
world. Color me skeptical.
