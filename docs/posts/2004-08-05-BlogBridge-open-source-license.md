**Link: [BlogBridge open source license](None):** ""

I've done a little research about what the Open Source really means, legally,
when it comes to [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>). I wrote about this
question a few months ago, and now, having consulted with people who know,
here's an update.

>>

>> First of all, start with the goals.

>>

>>   * BlogBridge should be available, in source code form and executable form
to everyone who wants to look at it and use it. It should be a bona fida open
source project.  
> **Reasoning** : We will be able to recruit others to help us build it; It is
> a significant differentiator among the other blog readers out there; And we
> can legitimately use services such as Source Forge to manage the project and
> its source code.
>>   * If a commercial entity wants to use the code to build a commercial
business, we would like them to have to come to us for permission.  
> **Reasoning** : Obviously, we aren't making any money on this; if someone
> else wants to, it would be nice if we were involved.

>>

>> As it turns out, this is not an unusual set of objectives, and it is pretty
straightforward to achieve.

>>

>> As of BlogBridge 0.5.4, the **product will be licensed under the GPL**
(rather than the [LGPL ](<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html>)which is
what we had before.)

>>

>> The effect of this is that the first objective above is fully achieved
**implicitly**. The second objective is achieved, indirectly:

>>

>> Because the GPL is quite strict in its requirements of releasing any
modifications, enhancements, etc also under the GPL, it makes the **source
code as it stands** unsuitable for a commercial purpose. The obligations
attached to modifying the source would really discourage anyone from building
a business around it.

>>

>> (You might wonder, once you've released something as Open Source, can you
decide to change the license? Isn't that prohibited? [It turns out that it's
perfectly alright.](</weblogs/archives/000471.html>))

>>

>> The code as it stands therefore is **incompatible** with a commercial
project. If we decide that we want to embark on, or give someone else the
ability to embark on a commercial project, what do we do?

>>

>> We release a copy of the source code under a different, commerical license.
This copy forms the basis of the commerical project. It's called "**dual
licensing "** and it's a well understood and accepted model.
