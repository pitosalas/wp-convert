**Link: [Safari now has Scribefire](None):** ""

Yay! One reason holding me to using FireFox on Mac was that I rely heavily on
[Scribefire](<http://www.scribefire.com/2010/06/07/scribefire-and-safari-
sitting-in-a-tree/>) which was not really working on Safari. I am using it now
on Safari 5. It seems ok but, first  blush it doesn't seem quite as nice as on
Firefox. But at least it gives me a chance to try starting to use Safari to
see if it's all it's cracked up to be! Check out Scribefire, on Firefox or
Safari (and I guess Chrome.)

Chrome: I just can't get used to it's weird tab user interface. There goes
Google again, reinventing the wheel. Gmail doesn't have folders, it has tags.
And now Chrome has funny tabs instead of ones that look 'normal'
