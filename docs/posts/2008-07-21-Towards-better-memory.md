An interesting, quirky, though-provoking -- memorable article in [Wired about
Memory](<http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all>):

> "[snip…]SuperMemo is based on the insight that there is an ideal moment to
> practice what you've learned. Practice too soon and you waste your time.
> Practice too late and you've forgotten the material and have to relearn it.
> The right time to practice is just at the moment you're about to forget."
