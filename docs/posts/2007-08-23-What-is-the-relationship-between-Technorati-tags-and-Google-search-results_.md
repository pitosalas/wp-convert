Bill Ives of the [[tag]Portals and KM[/tag]
blog](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/>) did an [interesting bit
of
analysis](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/2007/08/16-technorati-t.html>)
about how tagging with Technorati may or may not affect rankings in Google.

It's something I've been paying attention to as well. Recently I found this
really nice WordPress plug in that makes it dead easy to tag content in
Technorati. It's called
'[[tag]SimpleTags[/tag]](<http://www.broobles.com/scripts/simpletags/>)' and
it allows me to simply mark up the text I am writing inline and certain words
will automagically become Technorati tags.
