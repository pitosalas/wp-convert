A simple question that for some reason does not have a simple answer:

> "I want to follow someone's twitter feed using an RSS reader, where is it?"

Well it seems that for some reason Twitter has quite hidden it but as a public
service I will share the results of my research with you.

You will find it at:

    
    
    https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=username

So, for my twitter feed it is:

    
    
    <https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=pitosalas>[  
    ](<https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.rss?screen_name=pitosalas>)

Of course, users of [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com/look>) have a much
easier time and have many more options. With BlogBridge you can subscribe to a
person, to a list, or even to a general Twitter query, like "Object Oriented
Marketing".
