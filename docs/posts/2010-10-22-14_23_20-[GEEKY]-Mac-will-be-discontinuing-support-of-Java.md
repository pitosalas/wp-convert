title: "[GEEKY] Mac will be discontinuing support of Java"

This is a weird development. Java is a super well established language, why
would Apple decide to stop developing it:

"Apple's [announcement](<http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/21/apple-
discontinuing-java-installation-packages-for-mac-os-x/>) that they would be
ceasing future development of their version of Java for the Mac has generated
concern amongst Java developers." ( **from** : [Steve Jobs Comments on Apple's
Java Discontinuation - Mac Rumors](<http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/22/steve-
jobs-comments-on-apples-java-discontinuation/>).)

N.B. Apple is not saying they are ceasing support of Java, but development of
Java. I guess on other platforms (Windows etc.) the Java support and the Java
code provided all comes from Sun/Oracle.

Up to now Apple has been on the forefront of providing a strong Java
implementation on OS X. This presumably was because Apple felt strategically
that they needed to have a strong Java, and that Sun/Oracle would not be
providing it, presumably^2 because the OS X installed base was not large
enough to justify it. So in summary:

Apple previously believed:

  1. OS X can't be credible if it doesn't have a strong Java implementation.

  2. Sun will think that OS X is not a big enough market to justify the investment.

And now Apple believes:

  1. OS X no longer needs Java for credibility

  2. Perhaps the tables are now turned, and Sun/Oracle will need to have OS X to be credible going forward.

Interestingâ€¦

p.s. I just saw this [blog post where James Gosling comments on Java on Mac
and other recent
developments.](<http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/entry/steve_jobs_comments_on_apple>)
