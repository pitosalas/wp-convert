**Link: [Why you should build on Kubernetes from day one - Stack Overflow Blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/21/why-you-should-build-on-kubernetes-from-day-one/):** "If you’re building a new app today, it might be worth taking a closer look at making it cloud-native and using Kubernetes from the jump. The effort to set up Kubernetes is less than you think. Certainly, it’s less than the effort it would take to refactor your app later on to support containerization."
