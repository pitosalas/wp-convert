> "The Barking Dog model is different. You still build fences. Maybe even a
> fancy lock. But more importantly, you get a well-trained dog, maybe even two
> or three for redundancy. And you assume that some of your fences will fail,
> because that’s what fences do when faced with smart intruders. When they do
> fail, and someone comes in, that’s where the barking dog comes in. Your
> defenses may fail, but your detectors will sound the alarm, allow you to
> respond and, hopefully, recover from the intrusion." (**from:**[Fort Knox
