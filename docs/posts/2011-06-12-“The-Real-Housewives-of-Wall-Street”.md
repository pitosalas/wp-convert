Mike Taibi writes in [Rolling Stone about some fairly outrageous doings
between Washington D.C. and Wall Street during the various
'bailouts](<http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-real-housewives-of-
wall-street-look-whos-cashing-in-on-the-bailout-20110411>)':

> "Christy is the wife of John Mack, the chairman of Morgan Stanley. Susan is
> the widow of Peter Karches, a close friend of the Macks who served as
> president of Morgan Stanley's investment-banking division. Neither woman
> appears to have any serious history in business, apart from a few
> philanthropic experiences. Yet the Federal Reserve handed them both low-
> interest loans of nearly a quarter of a billion dollars through a
> complicated bailout program that virtually guaranteed them millions in risk-
> free income." (**from** [The Real Housewives of Wall
