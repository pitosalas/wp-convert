One of the tensions that I have seen in teaching software engineering is
whether something should be viewed as legitimate research or part of the craft
of computer engineering.

It's a slippery slope that I myself didn't have a good articulation for.

I came across [this in a newsgroup which I think is a pretty good
description.](<http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/4794/how-would-i-
justify-that-my-work-isnt-just-normal-design-and-creation>) The writer is
referring to [Researching Information Systems and
Computing](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/141290224X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=141290224X&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://www.assoc-
