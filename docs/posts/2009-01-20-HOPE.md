Chris and I, this morning, looking forward to a great day. We've waited and
worked for this. And now the day has come.

I saw the inauguration communally on a big screen at the Regent Theater in
Arlington with hundreds of other cheering folks. It was a fun and exciting
event. People even stood up for the actual oath of office.

Quite something!
