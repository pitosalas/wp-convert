Aviv, came up with the following solution: a new anti-Semitic cartoon contest,
with the submissions drawn by Jews themselves. "We'll show the world we can do
the best, sharpest, most offensive Jew hating cartoons ever published!" Sandy
said. "No Iranian will beat us on our home turf!" (**from** "[Applying the Old
