>> Well, not really dark: This is in reference to [Shel Isreal's recent bit
about
LinkedIn.](<http://seems2shel.typepad.com/itseemstome/2004/05/linkedin_part_3.html>)
Shel notes that [LinkedIn ](<http://www.linkedin.com/>)is actually **good for
recruiting**. He cites some examples of folks who assembled a team using
LinkedIn to locate candidates.

>>

>> **Think about the other side:** You're the CEO of a company. You've
discovered LinkedIn. It's kind of cool. You introduce some of your team to it.
Before long everyone is on LinkedIn.

>>

>> I remember a recuriter friend cautioning me that we shouldn't have people
supply **both their first and last names** in the their voice mail greetings
in our brand new startup. It would make it too easy for the best people to be
**poached** by other recruiters just dialing through the directory.

>>

>> LinkedIn is an **order of magnitude worse/better/more.**
