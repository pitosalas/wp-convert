>> [David Coursey writes an interesting bit
](<http://blog.ziffdavis.com/coursey/archive/2004/04/28/739.aspx>)about how
the competitors to Microft Office (i.e. Star Office, Word Perfect, what not)
need to get themselves an Outlook competitor, because that's the only (or
main) reason standing in the way of folks switching from Microsoft. A couple
of points:

>>

>>   * I can't believe that David feels that Outlook 2003 is so much better
than the previous version (Outlook XP.) I am usually a Microsoft fan but in
this case [there are various really bad design choices which make Outlook 2003
a constant aggrevation for me to use](</weblogs/archives/000373.html>). The
Spam filtering is one thing that is new and good, but not meaningful to me
because I am already using a very effective spam filtering app
([Matador](<http://www.mailfrontier.com/products_matador.html>))

>>   * Then again I am not an Outlook hater. I am amused when people I work
with berate Outlook how awful and useless it is, and insist on using Eudora.
The profoundly good thing about Outlook, which I am surprised no-one has
competed with is the integration of email, calendar and addressbook.

>>

>> **Synergies are everywhere** : I can use a single addressbook for both my
email addresses and phone numbers. I can use email to deliver and process
appointments and calendar updates. I can use the addressbook to point to
someone's free-busy information. These are incredibly important integrations:
the three functions (email, calendar and addressbook) **belong together.**
