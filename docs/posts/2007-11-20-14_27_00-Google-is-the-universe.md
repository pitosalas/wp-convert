As you may have heard, I've been learning all about Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) lately. I just came across this amazing little service called the
[DigPageRank Pagerank Checker](<http://digpagerank.com/index.php>). The story
goes something like this.

Google assigns every single page in the whole internet a numerical score
called the [Page
Rank](<http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPageRank&ei=Wi1CR6C3J5PkeZTMqboK&usg=AFQjCNEC6uBONjN7_DGwupaCx2_xT7KLUw&sig2=KyYQgijwkrL7JDSZ1z0WdA>)
(PR). It somehow says something about how **important** that page is and
consequently how high it should appear in your Google search results.

Like **Astrology** , [you can find lots of debate all around the web on how PR
is computed](<http://www.mathewbrowne.com/check-your-current-pagerank/>),
whether it means something or not. And when Google tweaks their algorithms so
that a particular web page goes up or down in PR, then this is big news in the
SEO community. It's a fact that where your site shows up in search results can
have a [dramatic financial impact on your
business.](<http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/11/29/what-should-you-do-
if-your-google-ranking-falls-and-you-lose-all-your-traffic/>)

So it's a world of move/countermove - a veritable arms race as Google tweaks
it's algorithm and web sites try to game the algorithm to raise their Page
Rank. And back and forth.

So back to this site the [PageRank
Checker](<http://digpagerank.com/index.php>). Type in a URL you will see not
simply the PageRank of said referenced page, but what the Page Rank is of that
page according to dozens of separate Google data centers.

What I find so fascinating about this report is that it raises the lid on the
unbelievably complex **super-parallel-global-spanning-computer-brain** that
Google has become.

I had heard about these data centers, but that there are so many, and that the
analysis of the PR of a certain page potentially yields different numbers is
interesting. It means that the PR calculation is done somehow separately in
these data centers, it says that probably the algorithm for computing the PR
can potentially actually be different (presumably as a result of their update
distribution mechanism.)

Maybe the Google brain will, [like
Colossus](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project>), "wake
up" and become the global consciousness, hack into the military computers
around the world on it's own initiative and black mail â€¦ _oh forget it._
