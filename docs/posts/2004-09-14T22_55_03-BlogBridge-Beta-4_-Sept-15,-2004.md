>> Ok, guys, we have another beta release with lots of great new goodies! It
will be up on the web site tomorrow hopefully. It sports lots of new features,
which I will be describing when I have some more time to do it. For now,
please go to the BlogBridge web site and look around. Some links of interest:

>> One of the cool new things in this beta is the **BlogStarz feature** ,
illustrated to the left. Notice that each Channel has several new pieces of
information. Not all are fully implemented yet. Click on the image to enlarge
it.

>>

>> Now, here's the **real** story:

>>

>>   * The icon on the top left (pointing up or down or not) indicates how
'popular' this Channel is. Today, Popularity is measured by the number of
inbound blog links as reported by **Technorati**.

>>   * The Starz in the top center summarize BlogBridge's measure of this
Channel's **interest to you**. One Starz - Not very; 5 Starz - Very Very.

>>   * The Icon on the top right (heart or bomb) is clickable. It is where you
subjectively tell BlogBridge how you feel about this Channel. Kind of a **Tivo
Thumbs** up/down. By the way, of course this icon will change to a thumb.

>>   * Finally there are 3 numbers at the bottom left. These correspond to how
many articles there are total in this Channel, how many you have not read, and
how many BlogBridge guesses you will consider Good articles. The numbers go in
the opposite order: good / unread / total.

>>

>> **Try the new beta. I hope you like it. Let me know!**
