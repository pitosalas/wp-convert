So now that I made a point about my
[skepticism](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptics>) about whatever
politicians say about the economy (see "[Who Can I believe about the
economy](</2009/02/08/who-can-i-believe-about-the-economy/>)") here's some
more.One pal told me, nicely, that my appreciation for Paul Krugman was
misguided, that Krugman's a socialist (whatever that means) and that Krugman's
way off base and extremely partisan. Whoops. Now I am even more confused.
