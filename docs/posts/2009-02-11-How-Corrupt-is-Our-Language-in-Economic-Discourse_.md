# [How Corrupt is Our Language in Economic Discourse?](None)




Check out this post [How Corrupt is Our Language in Economic
Discourse?](<http://austrianeconomists.typepad.com/weblog/2009/02/how-corrupt-
is-our-language-in-economic-discourse.html>):

> "And as Deirdre McCloskey has put it, when your intellectual range is from
> M-N you think you are being open minded when you look at M and you look at
> N, but you certainly don't see A or Z. " ( **from:** from [The Austrian
> Economists](<http://austrianeconomists.typepad.com/weblog/atom.xml>))

So now that I made a point about my
[skepticism](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptics>) about whatever
politicians say about the economy (see "[Who Can I believe about the
economy](</2009/02/08/who-can-i-believe-about-the-economy/>)") here's some
more.One pal told me, nicely, that my appreciation for Paul Krugman was
misguided, that Krugman's a socialist (whatever that means) and that Krugman's
way off base and extremely partisan. Whoops. Now I am even more confused.
