One of the reason that society needs people to transact with each other using
real identities, maybe, is that in the end, virtual digital persona can’t own
and transfer ownership. I can’t buy or sell or trade with a virtual digital
persona. Corporations in fact are virtual people in some sense, and indeed
they are legally regulated much like people are.

>> Maybe in the future the law will expand to allow my virtual identity to own
and transact separately from me, with it’s own ‘social security number’, the
ability to have a checking account, to own property and generate income. But
for that to happen it would seem to me that the law would have to catch up and
regulate digital personas as a third actor along with natural people and
corporate-like entities.
