[ I Was Wrong About Mastodon – EscapingTech](<
https://escapingtech.com/tech/opinions/i-was-wrong-about-mastodon-
moderation.html>) –Excellent article explaining mastodon logic and semantixs,
especially with respect to the relationship that instances have to each other
and what moderation options instance operstors have. The author: “I said that
Mastodon moderation wouldn't scale, it does. The cultural differences will
likely continue to maintain a friendlier atmosphere regardless of size.”
