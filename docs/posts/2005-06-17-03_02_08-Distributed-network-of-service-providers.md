>> I came across [ServiceMagic](<http://www.servicemagic.com/>), which is a
pretty cool site for locating and hiring people to work on projects around the
house. I needed three doors repaired and on a lark I posted the project on
this site. I had a phone call in 5 minutes, and 2 more within the hour. I
chose one of them to come by and give me a free estimate in 2 days.

back. Now lets see the quality of the service!
