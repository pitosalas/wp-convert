An interesting article in Forbes about Software Developers and Development in
general, [The Rise of
Developeronomics](<http://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2011/12/05/the-
rise-of-developeronomics/>). While here and there he is promoting old
chestnuts which may or may not be true there is a core argument which is quite
intriguing. It goes something like this:

  1. All companies are becoming software companies, meaning they are driven by software whatever their business actually is.
  2. Hence a key resource to a successful business is an effective, efficient and scalable capability to create innovative computer driven systems. Programmers are scarce.
  3. Hence the way to invest in the future is to cultivate great and excellent developers who believe in you, are willing to follow your vision and will commit to your projects.

Sometimes I wonder whether business writers come up with a two paragraph
insight or story idea and bulk it up into a 3 page article, or whether I am
just not appreciating their craft. In any event, [Venkatesh Rao
](<http://blogs.forbes.com/venkateshrao/>)writes:

Wow. And a little further on he warns:

> "In what follows, I am deliberately going to talk about the developers like
> they are products in a meat market. For practical purposes, they are, since
> the vast majority of them havenât found a way to use their own scarcity to
> their advantage. Which means others find a way to do so. In capitalism,
> every human is either a capitalist, somebody elseâs capital, or
> economically worthless. Today, this abstract point specifically translates
> to: people who can invest in developers, developers, and everybody else. (
