**Link: [How hard is it to cheat with ChatGPT in technical interviews? We ran an experiment.](https://interviewing.io/blog/how-hard-is-it-to-cheat-with-chatgpt-in-technical-interviews):** "As an experiment, we asked interviewees to cheat with ChatGPT during their interviews and share who got away with it."

This is really interesting experiment conducted to detect cheating in interviewing. It also has a lot of thoughts about how to do a good technical interview. Worth reading.
