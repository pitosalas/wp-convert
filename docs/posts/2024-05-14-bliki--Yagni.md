**Link: [bliki: Yagni](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html):** "Yagni ("You Aren't Gonna Need It") is the principle that we should not build presumptive features. It should not be used as a justification for neglecting internal quality." 

Another longer article about YAGNI by the pretty-famous Martin Fowler.
