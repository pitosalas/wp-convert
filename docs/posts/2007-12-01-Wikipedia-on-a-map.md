Vision](https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/wp-
content/uploads/imagewell//wikipediavision.jpg?w=584)I am a huge fan of
Wikipedia. Here's a new neat hack: [Wikipedia
Vision](<http://www.lkozma.net/wpv/index.html>).

This is a live, animated, world map, showing in real time each edit to the
Wikipedia, as it happens. Makes the world feel even smaller, doesn't it? It's
a cool way to learn about topics in Wikipedia that you may not have known
about.
