Everything's a camp today, Foo Camp, Bar Camp and now [Transparency
Camp](<http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/TransparencyCamp>). I am attending this
gathering in Washington D.C. to get closer to what's going on in the open
government movement. This is a pretty succinct summary of what it's about:

> "Convening a trans-partisan tribe of open government advocates from all
> walks — government representatives, technologists, developers, ngos, wonks &
> activists — to share knowledge on how to use new technologies to make our
> government transparent and meaningfully accessible to the public." (
> **from** [Transparency Camp](<http://transparencycamp.org/>))

**What a new world**! The degree of penetration of web 2.0, social media and
technology into the machinations of the government is an eye-opener. There is
also a lot of well informed passion around digging in around the edges of how
things work, from legislation, to lobbying, to governing.

My **question** is, **what is the impact of this,** **so far**? While that's
not exactly clear to me (today) I feel that there will be an inevitable impact
over time. These are early days, but this is very important work.
