really popular service which compares the music you like with others' tastes
as they play music in iTunes.

It's a handy way to discover new music. As you can see in the screenshot to
the left, it displays all this in a very nice little window to the right of
the iTunes window. All very cool.

Not only do you see other related music that I may be interested in, it also
offers me downloads of free, up and coming artists who might interest me.

And then, it shows me nice litte pictures of other iLike users who listen to
Beethoven or whoever.
