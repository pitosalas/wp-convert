I wrote [recently about Fake Steve and wondered aloud how he could get away
with what he gets away with](</2007/11/28/how-does-fake-steve-get-away-with-
this/>).

If that thread interested you at all, you've got to go look at the latest
shenanigans that Fake Steve is reporting in his blog. [He's being offered big
bucks to stop blogging.](<http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/12/breakfast-

[](<http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/>)Hall of mirrors. Is this Fake Steve Jobs
speaking, or is it [Daniel
Lyons](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/technology/06steve.html>) for real,
or is it [Fake Daniel
Lyons](<https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=32454861&postID=5208247252090415286>)?
