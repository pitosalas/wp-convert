(**Web site except:** I was super excited when I first heard about the prepend feature included in the Ruby 2.0 release, but never had a chance to use it. Micah Cooper and I were working in an existing code base recently, and one of the project's requirements was to log API requests that took longer than a given threshold. The project talked to multiple APIs via XML, JSON and SOAP. We didn't want to change the existing code, because it had been tested and was working in production.)
