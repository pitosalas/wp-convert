title: "[ETECH] A9 as a search portal – Amazon defines “Searchlets”"

>> Jeff Bezos talked about a new feature of A9 which allows the basic A9
Search Page to be extended by anyone, using what I am calling "
**Searchlets**." Here's an explanation…

>>

>> If you've looked at A9 you've seen the various " **vertical** " result
regions that you can ask for - there are a handful built in, including for
example the yellow pages result which shows you photographs of the
establishments identified.

>>

>> A9 is now providing an API allowing anyone to extend this with their own,
specialized search result engine - a cute pun on "vertical." [Here's how you
choose from a collection.](<http://a9.com/-/search/moreColumns.jsp>) What they
are letting users do is to add "searchlets" to the A9 "Search portal."

>>

>> This is a very **interesting** move - both for the **clever** insight of
making it extensible and for the **strategic** questions it raises, for
example:

>>

>>   * Will Amazon " **unbundle** " their own core search verticals?

>>

>>   * Can **anyone** build a search portal providing this same API?

>>

>>   * What does this mean to Amazon and A9?

>>

>>   * What does it mean to Google and Yahoo?

>>

>>

>> Think about this: if A9's cool Yellow Pages search (which includes the
images) was available as a "searchlet" and Google allows the user to add tabs
using the A9 Searchlet API, then **what happens**?
