**[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>) has spiffy new icons. **More
progress the last week or so, with the addition of [some nicenew eye
candy](<http://www.blogbridge.com/images/blogbridge.jpg>). It's getting closer
and closer to being usable for real. If you want to try it out, send me an
email and I will tell you where to download it. (It's not ready for prime time
yet, though, just for playing around.)
