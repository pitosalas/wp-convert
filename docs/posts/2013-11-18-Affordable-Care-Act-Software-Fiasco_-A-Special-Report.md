I came across this video by Armando Fox with his views of what went wrong with
the Obamacare website, from a deep technical perspective. It's part of a
[University of California at Berkley course on SAAS Software
Engineering.](<https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS.169.2x/3T2013/courseware/64746ad0f2b84ce2af1f1b627c735866/>)
It's very very good!
