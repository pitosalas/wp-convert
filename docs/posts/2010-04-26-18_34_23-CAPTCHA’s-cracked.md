CAPTCHA is the nickname of the venerable (ok only a few years of veneration)
technique of verifying if the person on the other side of the screen is
actually a person not a computer. We've all seen them a million times: a very
hard to read bit of text in a small box, with a request that you decipher it
and type in the text into another box.

Well it seems that spammers have figured out a way to defeat them: yes, you
guessed it, "Captcha Farms." I first thought they were some exaggerated fear
mongering but I suppose their commonplace enough that it's being reported even
in, the, g-u-l-p, New York Times:

> "Sophisticated spammers are paying people in
> [India](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/india/index.html?inline=nyt-
> geo> "More news and information about India."),
> [Bangladesh](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/bangladesh/index.html?inline=nyt-
> geo> "More news and information about Bangladesh."),
> [China](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-
> geo> "More news and information about China.") and other developing
> countries to tackle the simple tests known as captchas, which ask Web users
> to type in a string of semiobscured characters to prove they are human
> beings and not spam-generating robots." ( **from** [Spammers Paying Others
> to Solve Captchas, from the
> NYT.)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/technology/26captcha.html?partner=rss&emc=rss>)

Except I've heard of an even more subversive variation, where spammers put up
what appear to be run of the mill porn sites, that, instead of asking you to
pay with cash for access, ask you to solve a captcha for each image or video
or whatever. (whatever?) Poor guy is not only solving it to gain access, they
are also solving it, in real time, to help a spammer gain access to some site
they are attacking. Creative.
