I am at [Gnomedex](<http://www.gnomedex.com/>) and the news is spreading like
wildfire: [TechMeme](<http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/06/30/techmeme-hacked/>)
the venerable site that serves as the early warning of anything interesting,
has been **hacked**! Who would have thought!  [Actually a geekily-amusing
self-referential bit of social engineering] Technorati Tags:
