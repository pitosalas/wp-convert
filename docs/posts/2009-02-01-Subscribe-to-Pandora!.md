**Link: [Subscribe to Pandora!](None):** ""

I've known about [Pandora](<http://www.pandora.com>) for ages, and the last
month or so have been using it again, a lot. It's quite amazing: **constant,
free, music**. Based on your interests.

How does it work? Well just go to [Pandora](<http://www.pandora.com>), set up
a free account, and indicate, for example, an artist or style you like. It
begins playing songs, one after another which people who've liked what you
like have also liked. You hear a song or artist you don't know, indicate with
a thumb up or down how you like it. That's it.

I have discovered artists I didn't know, rediscovered some that I knew, or
music that I loved and had not heard before. All for free.

One might ask, in a favorite theme of mine, how do they survive? Here is
Pandora one of the most popular sites and applications on the web and on
iPhones, giving it all away. And the artists, how are they surviving? It's a
mystery isn't it.

Well not so much of a mystery. Apparently [Pandora came close to having to
shut itself down. No
money](<http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/pandora_on_the_verge_of_closing_shop.php>):

I just **did what I knew I should do**.

I signed up for an annual subscription.

Yes it cost $36, not that cheap. About what perhaps you might contribute to a
public radio station.

We can't expect that valuable stuff (newspapers? music? software?) continue to
be created by passionate talented people without the prospect of being able
get paid for it.
