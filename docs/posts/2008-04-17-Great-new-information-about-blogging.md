I just wrote a few brief tutorials that I thought might be of interest to you
and, well, everyone. Please check them out - if you find them useful, please
pass them on to your friends!

  * ["What's the difference between a blog and a web site?"](<http://www.squidoo.com/differenceblogandwebsite/>) - That perennial question that people first discovering blogging often ask. My short and sweet explanation.

  * ["How to put a blog on my web site" ](<http://www.squidoo.com/blogonwebsite/>)- A brief explanation why anyone with a web site might want to consider adding a blog to it, and how you might do that

  * ["What are the best news blogs"](<http://www.squidoo.com/bestnewsblogs/>) - How do you go about finding the best blogs about current events?
