I was supposed to fly from San Fransisco to Boston today. Monday (2 days ago)
I got an email from [JetBlue](<http://www.jetblue.com>) saying, more or less:
"Sorry to tell you, but your flight has been canceled. Please call 1-800-xxx
to make a new reservation or get a refund." No explanation of why. I was taken
aback, but I guess it happens all the time. After spending 30 minutes on hold,
I was able to make new plans which had me leaving a day early (yesterday.)
Back safe and sound now.

To JetBlue's credit for the moment, they are waving all change fees and more
importantly, any fare differences. From their web site it seems like the
flight was canceled due to 'weather.' While indeed tonight at 10pm we're
supposed to be in the middle of a blizzard here in Boston, on Monday, when
they canceled, the weather today was predicted to ok. I guess they have better
weather forecasters than the weather channel!
