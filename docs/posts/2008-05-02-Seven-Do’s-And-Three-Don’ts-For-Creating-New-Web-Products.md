[Seven Do’s And Three Don’ts For Creating New Web
Products](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WhyDoesEverythingSuck/~3/281422506/seven-
dos-and-three-donts-for-creating.html>) contains some excellent **Do 's and
Don'ts** for someone (like me) thinking of starting a new business. Here is
just one little 'Do' with which I agree whole heartedly.

> "1\. **Do become a domain expert in some domain.** If you are a computer
> science/programming oriented entrepreneur, there is a great temptation to
> try to solve general broad problems. This is because we tend to have no
> other skills. If you study programming that *is* a skill, but you need to
> marry that with some understanding of some real world issue. I strongly
> suggest finding an activity that has a problem and learning inside and out
> about the people that do that activity and what real issues they have that
> you may be able to solve." (from [Seven Do’s And Three Don’ts For Creating
