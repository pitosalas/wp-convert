This is too funny. Here's a taste, but you should read the whole article
saying [how an Israeli should adapt to living in the United
States.](<http://avi-rubin.blogspot.com/2011/05/advice-for-israelis-coming-to-
us.html>) For example, this is about the express line in the super market:

> "The express line operates differently in American grocery stores, and might
> take some getting used to. The 10 item limit is strictly enforced. It would
> not be considered normal for you to haggle and argue with the sales clerk
> and to raise your voice because you _only_ have 11 items. It is even less
> likely that as you stood your ground, the people in line behind you would
> start to call you names and to yell at the clerk for not moving on. And do
> not expect six people to simultaneously yell at each other at the top of
> their lungs as a result of this unlikely confrontation. As you can see, the
> express line requires an adjustment period for any Israeli, and is perhaps
> the place where you will first start to feel homesick." (**from** [Advice
