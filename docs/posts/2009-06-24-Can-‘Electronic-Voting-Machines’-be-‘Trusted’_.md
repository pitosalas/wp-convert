title: "Can ‘Electronic Voting Machines’ be ‘Trusted’?"

Leaving aside _what_ exactly an Electronic Voting Machine _is_ , the New York
Times weighed in with this editorial the other day:

> "Electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper record of every vote
> cast cannot be trusted. In 2008, more than one-third of the states,
> including New Jersey and Texas, still did not require all votes to be
> recorded on paper. Representative Rush Holt has introduced a good
> [bill](<http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2894:> "H.R. 2894")
> that would ban paperless electronic voting in all federal elections.
> Congress should pass it while there is still time to get ready for 2010
> […[click here for the whole
> thing](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/opinion/22mon2.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=electronic%20voting&st=cse>)]"
> ( **from** [How to Trust Electronic Voting, New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/opinion/22mon2.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=electronic%20voting&st=cse>))

I wasn't sure whether or not Representative Holt's bill was good or not, so I
was interested to read this commentary on another influential elections
related blog. Let me jump to the punchline:

> " _The New York Times_ just doesn't get it. You'd think, by now, they would.
> But they don't. And they should print a correction immediately […snip…]" (
> **from** [New York Times wrong again on
> E-Voting](<http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7249#more-7249>)')

and more:

> "[snip…]The reference to "paperless electronic voting", aside from being so
> very 2005, is also incredibly misleading. The idea that "electronic voting
> machines that…produce a paper record" are somehow more trustworthy than
> those which don't, has long ago been discredited by computer scientists and
> security experts.[snip…]" ( **also from** [New York Times wrong again on
> E-Voting](<http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7249#more-7249>)')

And here then is another rebuttal from [someone who believes that having any
automation involved in counting votes is big
trouble:](<http://www.opednews.com/author/author2302.html>)

> "[snip…]The simple fact is: you can NOT trust electronic voting. No paper
> receipts, paper ballots, recounts (where, as we saw in NH's 2008 primary
> recount, ballot chain of custody is a joke and recounts are likely conducted
> with compromised ballots to validate a fraudulent computerized count), no
> statistically improbable audits (as proposed by Mr. Holt), can reverse the
> untrustworthy and completely unverifiable results of a privatized,
> computerized, non-public, concealed vote count.[snip…]" ( **from** "[Forget
> Iran, say NO to concealed vote counting in the US of
> A"](<http://www.opednews.com/articles/Forget-Iran-say-NO-to-con-by-Nancy-
> Tobi-090623-712.html>))

You can see that there are strong opinions.

Yet, I wonder whether, looking into the real future (50 - 100 years) anyone
can imagine that we will still be marking up pieces of paper and then scanning
them. I don't think so, therefore the only question is how long it will take.
