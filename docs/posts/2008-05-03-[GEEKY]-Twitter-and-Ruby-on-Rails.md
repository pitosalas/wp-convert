Well you know I am a Ruby on Rails fan and often when I propose it I am asked
whether 'Rails will Scale'. Here are my quick thoughts:

  1. First of all, is the rumor true? See comment at the bottom of the post referenced above:

  2. Twitter is at the extreme end of scalability challenges. It is a huge and incredibly fast growing system, so if anything would break scalability, it would be Twitter.
  3. No system of the scale of Twitter uses a single language of platform. I would be surprised if there's not a grab bag of PHP, Java, C, SQL stored procedures and other technologies in the overall architecture. So the notion of 'abandoning Rails for Java' doesn't really make much sense anyway.
  4. Most important: Designing, building and operating a system to achieve good performance at Twitter scale is really really hard no matter what language or framework you use. Using Java or PHP or C# or whatever you like doesn't change this basic fact. Consequently changing language of framework would not be a likely cure for a scaling problem.
