**Link: [New Book: Founder’s Dilemmas](None):** ""



This book looks good: "Founder's Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the
pitfalls that can sink a startup". I came across it in the "Startup Lessons
Learned" Blog, which may be the best blog about leann startups.

This excerpt talks about a common scenario with startups, where the founders
assume that they way they chose to split equity on day 0 will continue to work
for them as time goes on:

> "How should founders deal with such developments? In short, by assuming when
> they do the initial split that things will change, even if the specific
> changes cannot be foreseen, and therefore structuring a dynamic equity split
> rather than the static splits used at Zipcar, govWorks, and many other
> startups. As important as it is to get the initial equity split rightâby
> matching it as closely as possible thefoundersâ past contributions,
> opportunity costs, future contributions, and motivationsâit is equally
> important to keep it right; that is, to be able to adjust the split as
> circumstances change." ( **from**[Founder's Dilemmas: Equity
> Splits)](<http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/>)

I think I will be getting the book.

_p.s. not to be a scrooge, but shouldn 't the title be "Founders' Dilemmas"?_
