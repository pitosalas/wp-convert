[ 4 Books For Intermediate Ruby And Rails Developers.](<
https://manny.codes/4-books-for-intermediate-ruby-and-rails-developers/>) –I’m
a fan of good books. Through my Ruby and Rails journey, I’ve discovered a few
excellent books that I’d like to share with fellow Rubyists. The authors of
these books are experts in their fields. These books are my recommendation and
I think they deserve some space on your desk.
