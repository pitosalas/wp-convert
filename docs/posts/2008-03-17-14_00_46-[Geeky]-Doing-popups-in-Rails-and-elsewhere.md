So my little toy pedagogical application needed a pretty popup box. Actually I
wanted one so I could see close up some of the alternatives. In the process I
came across three different code snippets, each one doing it in a little bit
different way. For you and me, here are the links:

  * The [DOM-popup kit, by Stuart Rackham](<http://www.methods.co.nz/popup/popup.html>)

  * The [FAMSPAM Facebox package by Chris Wantrath](<http://famspam.com/facebox>)

  * The [Bubble Tooltip kit by Alessandro Fulciniti with an assist by Annalisa Afeltra](<http://www.railsonwave.com/railsonwave/2008/1/28/title>)

I tried the first two, but the third looks cool too. I liked Facebox the best.
Your mileage may/will vary.
