>> [Scoble ](<http://scoble.weblogs.com/>)bemoans the fact that folks aren't
all using the XML Icon, and he cites [Random
Bytes.](<http://www.byte.org/blog>)

>>

>> (Lucky Random Bytes for being mentioned by Scoble. As they say in
Holleywood, you can say anything you like about me, just as long as you spell
my name right.)

>>

>> While I have always felt that XML icons, RSS, RSS Versions, and other geeky
things **should be hidden from regular users** , for this point in time,
Scoble is right.

>>

>> Until we have nice 1-click subscribing with user meaningful gestures rather
than rss.xml, some elementary standardization around a name and an icon is
highly desirable.

>>

>> Now to add insult to injury, using [Syndic8's RSS Feed Autodiscovery lookup
for Random Bytes
](<http://www.syndic8.com/feedlist.php?ShowMatch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.byte.org%2Fblog&ShowStatus=all>)yielded
3 different rss URLs:

>>

>>   * <http://www.byte.org/blog/index.xml>

>>   * <http://www.byte.org/blog/rblog.xml>

>>   * <http://www.byte.org/blog/rss.xml>

>>

>> What is a user to do now?
