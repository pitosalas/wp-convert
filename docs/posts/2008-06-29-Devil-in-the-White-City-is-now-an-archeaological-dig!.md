I am just finished reading [Devil In The White
City](<http://www.amazon.com/Devil-White-City-Madness-Changed/dp/0375725601>)
by Erik Larson. Loved it!

This news item about the [first archaeological dig at the site of the 1893
World's Columbian Exposition](<http://www.physorg.com/news130431733.html>)
caught my eye because that is what the book is about (also about a serial
murderer, but that's something else again.) I am only part way through the
book but it's quite good so far.
