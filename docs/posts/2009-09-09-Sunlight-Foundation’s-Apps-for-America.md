Sunlight Foundation is a very cool organization that I've been close to. They
are involved with many efforts to further government transparency and
accountability, often using technology, but not only.

Recently they ran their second competition looking for interesting and useful
applications and tools to be built using or leveraging data published by
government.

It's a clever model: offer $10,000 or so to a winner who creates and submits
the most interesting entry. Give applicants encouragement, publicity and
assistance. I have to believe that this creates a groundswell of energy and
hacking that furthers the foundations goals and uses the prize money in a
highly leveraged way.

The [latest Apps for America competition has just announced its
winners](<http://sunlightfoundation.com/presscenter/releases/2009/09/09/sunlight-
names-apps-america2-winners/>).

The first prize winner is [Datamasher.org](<http://datamasher.org>), a Web
application designed by Forum One Communications that lets anyone—no
programming background required—choose different government data sets and mash
them up to create visualizations and compare results on a state by state
basis.

The second prize winner is [GovPulse](<http://govpulse.us/>), which allows
viewers to quickly search the Federal Register in a variety of ways, including
by agency or date. And the third was
[ThisWeKnow.org](<http://thisweknow.org>), which lets users type in their zip
code and get back a wealth of information about their neighborhood drawn from
different agencies.

Very cool!
