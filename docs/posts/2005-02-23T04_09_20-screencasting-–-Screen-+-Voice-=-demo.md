term](<http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/02/21.html#a1182>),
[screencasting](<http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/11/11/primetime.html>):
creating little informal movies from screen captures plus audio, used
particularly for [demonstrating
software](<http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/12.html#a1113>)e and web
features.

off](<http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/02/17.html#a1179>) a really cute
Google Maps hack. Well more than cute: _impressive and very instructive_.

>> Anyway, I'm trying my hand at this in practice, both to **learn** about the
new medium and to **illustrate** some BlogBridge features.

>> After a bunch of **false starts** , playing with tools and utilities and
microphones that aren't on here's my [ first quasi-successful
attempt.](<http://www.blogbridge.com/movies/bbmovie1.mov>) I don't think it's
quite practical yet. For one, at 6Meg it's way **too big**.

>>

>> But it is an interesting **start**. I will continue to look at it and
report as I go.
