I have often been heard to say: "Ideas are Cheap", by which I mean to say that
my admiration goes more with the implementation, the making real and tangible,
of an idea than the idea itself. It's much easier to come up with something
that would be cool and useful ("A solar powered ambulance", "a retractable and
reusable parachute", "email on steroids") than actually design it, build it,
realize it.

I believe that as much about my own ideas as about anyone else's. BlogBridge
was supposed to be "an RSS reader done right".

I have a few wonderful ideas for new products, like "Twittepedia" which is an
encyclopedia with 140 character definitions. Wouldn't it be nice not to be
able to learn what "geometry", or "racisim" or "bernoulli effect" are without
having to read a 10,000 words wikipedia article?

There, I just gave it away. Why? Because ideas are cheap, and building that
service and making it successful is what really counts.

As it turns out, [Mark Twain had the same
idea.](<http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/05/10/mark-twain-helen-
keller-plagiarism-originality/>) So you see, even the idea that Ideas Are
Cheap is itself cheap. How meta.

This is from [Mark Twain's Letters, Volume
2](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1144580935/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=blogbridge-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1144580935>)![](http://www.assoc-
