Yes there's been lots of rumors of [Microsoft acquiring Yahoo, or
Logitech.](<http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-rumorville-microsoft-yahoo-
microsoft-logitech-news-corp-monster/>) They come and go constantly.

I am starting one (a rumor that is) that has not been mentioned  Microsoft
will buy Amazon. I will state my case, very briefly:

Amazon has been building an amazing platform of services for their online
store which they make available to the world at large. I am sure you've heard
of many of them available via [Amazon Web Services, such as S3 and
EC2](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361>). Newer ones like
DevPay and SimpleDB.

Microsoft is feeling pressure from Google, that continues to create the worlds
best known services platform and is attracting all kinds attention. So much so
that [Microsoft talks about the need to create analogous
services](<http://www.microsoft-
watch.com/content/web_services_browser/ray_ozzie_speaks_out.html>) in response
to Google.

I know what a massive strategic undertaking this would be; I know that
Microsoft must be scared and pissed at Google; I know that Amazon already has
this, and that Microsoft has said they want it.

But what do I know, it's just a rumor.
