Another great column from [Frank Rich -- Tiger Woods, Person of The
Year](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/opinion/20rich.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all>).
I recommend reading the whole thing. Here's a telling quote:

> "The most lethal example, of course, were the two illusions marketed to us
> on the way to Iraq — that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and
> some link to Al Qaeda. That history has since been rewritten by Bush alumni,
> Democratic politicians who supported the Iraq invasion and some of the news
> media that purveyed the White House fictions (especially the television
> press, which rarely owned up to its failure as print journalists have). It
> was exclusively “bad intelligence,” we’re now told, that pushed us into the
> fiasco. But contradictions to that “bad intelligence” were in plain sight
> during the run-up to the war — even sometimes in the press.
>
> Yet we wanted to suspend disbelief. Much of the country, regardless of
> party, didn’t want to question its leaders, no matter how obviously they
> were hyping any misleading shred of intelligence that could fit their
> predetermined march to war. It’s the same impulse that kept many from
> questioning how Mark McGwire’s and Barry Bonds’s outlandishly cartoonish
> physiques could possibly be steroid-free." ( **from** [Frank Rich, Tiger
> Woods, Person of The
> Year](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/opinion/20rich.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all>))
