On a lark, I used my frequent flyer miles to fly First Class on American
Airlines today, heading out to the O'Reily ETech Conference.

>> It felt so 'eighties' to me - faux luxury dining in a tin can at 40,000
feet:

>>

>>> _" Mr. Salas, would you like a drink before take-off? Mr. Salas, what
would you like for dinner tonight? Spinach and Cheese Pasta or Chicken Kiev?"_  
> …I am handed a heated towlette to wipe my weary brow… _"
>>>

>>> Mr. Salas, is there anything I can do for you? Mr. Salas, what would you
like to drink before dinner?"_

>>>

>>> …I get a nice bowl of mixed nuts, heated! And my diet-coke… …Dinner is
served. Linnen napkin, nice salad with capers and vinnigraite…

>>>

>>> _" Mr Salas, white or red wine with dinner? Mr Salas, is there anything
else I can do for you? Mr. Salas can I take that for you?"_

>>

>> It's just a little bit too subservient for my taste. But at least the
legroom is excellent, even though the silverware was plastic.
