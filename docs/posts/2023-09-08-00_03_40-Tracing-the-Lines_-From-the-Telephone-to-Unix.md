Great history about Unix!

(**Web site except:** The telephone, invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, sparked a revolution in communication. A year later, in 1877, he established the Bell Telephone Company. This marked the beginning of a fascinating journey, leading to the formation of the Volta Bureau in 1880. Guided by Bell, the Volta Bureau became a research hub, making strides in multiple scientific fields.)
