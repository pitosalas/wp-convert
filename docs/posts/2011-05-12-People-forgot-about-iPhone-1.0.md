Funny to read this:

Don't you remember (it's not so long ago) that when the iPhone came out, Apple
and Steve Jobs were vehement against opening it up to developers? This is from
October 1, 2007:

> "We have been trying to come up with a solution to expand the capabilities
> of the iPhone by letting developers write great apps for it, yet keep the
> iPhone reliable and secure," Jobs told developers at the Worldwide
> Developers Conference in June. That solution was Web-based applications,
> which is sort of like being told that you can't buy a DVD because HBO shows
> that movie every month or so, and it was met with tepid applause by Apple's
> developers." (from "[Trouble in iPhone
> Paradise](<http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-9788616-37.html?tag=mncol;txt>)")
