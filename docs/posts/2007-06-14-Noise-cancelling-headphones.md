I've been doing quite a bit of traveling lately and have been experimenting
with those noise cancelling headphones. Actually I couldn't convince myself to
spend $350 on the Bose headphones who, by reputation anyway, set the standard.

I spent about $50 on a pair of Sony noise canceling headphones (at RadioShack
no less.) My assessment: I give them a solid "B". They do cancel noise, but
not all of it. And having nothing to compare themm with, I am always wondering
how much better the better ones are.

So, today, in David Poque's column in the New York Times comes this article:
["Headphones to Shut out the
World"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/technology/14pogue.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin>)
in which he gives a nice comparison of the many options out there and even
recommends a pair of far less expensive ones:

> "So what’s the verdict? Nobody has yet knocked Bose off its pedestal, but
> Panasonic and Audio-Technica have climbed up there with it. These headphones
> sound amazing, but cost a half or a third as much." (from ["Headphones to
> Shut out the
> World"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/technology/14pogue.html?_r=1&ref=technology&oref=slogin>))

David's personal blog talks about the responses he's already gotten from his
readers in "[Blocking Out Background
Noise".](<http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/blocking-out-background-
noise/>)a where readers recommend el-cheapo (yes, I do speak Spanish) ear
protection as a viable alternative:

> "As another reader put it: “”I have a Bose QuietComfort 2 headset which
> transforms my daily  
> commute into almost a recreational activity. But I’ve found a better  
> solution: Get a pair of lightweight, industrial hearing protection ear  
> muffs for no more than $20 by Bilsom. (I love these:
> <http://tinyurl.com/2r4a6y>).”

Interesting. That's a cool idea, perhaps worth trying. I bet the Bilsom will
last longer than even the Bose. But it's kind of big and ugly, don't ya think?
