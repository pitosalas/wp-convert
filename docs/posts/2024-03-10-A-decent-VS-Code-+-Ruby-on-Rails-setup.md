**Link: [A decent VS Code + Ruby on Rails setup](https://railsnotes.xyz/blog/vscode-rails-setup?utm_source=railsnotes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=the-railsnotes-newsletter-issue-28):** "Setting up VS Code for Ruby on Rails development can be tricky, so I wrote this article to help.
