[SnapLogic](<http://www.snaplogic.com>) is an open source product (at least in
it's base edition) providing tools to construct pipelines that deliver and
process and filter information through collections of interconnected REST
services.

As usual, they provide a free 'community' edition, and then variously priced
developer and enterprise editions. Pricing wasn't indicated but if you have
this kind of need, [SnapLogic](<http://www.snaplogic.com>) looks like it's
worth a peek.
