I came across this [good post from Don
Dodge](<http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2010/05/how-to-unlock-
your-creative-genius.html>) which I wanted to share. Don was at Microsoft and
is now at Google. He cites a [New York Times article about
creativity](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/books/08creative.html>), which
I've also read. I recommend both. Here's Don:

> "We are all creative but our human experience filters, and conscious mind,
> block out creative bursts. We are much more creative while sleeping when the
> subconscious mind is free to think outside the box and associate thought
> fragments in totally new ways. Think about your dreams. You create the
> characters, the story line, the scenes, the dialog,  
> everything. All of us have a little Steven Spielberg inside us" ( **from**
