[ Opinion | The Alt-Right Manipulated My Comic. Then A.I. Claimed It.](< https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/opinion/sarah-andersen-how-algorithim-took-my-work.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare>) –Another interesting continuation of the debate on the impact of chatGPT and Stable diffusion and the other newest ai based creative genetors.
