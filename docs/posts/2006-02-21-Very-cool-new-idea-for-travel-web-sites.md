You probably already follow TechCrunch but if you don't take a look at Flyspy,
a very clever new idea for adding very useful information to booking flights
online.

city and optionally a departure date and length of stay. The search result,
which returns very quickly, will present me with a graph of flight prices over
the next 30 days so that I can quickly look at which days are the cheapest to
fly. To book a flight I just click on the point in the graph. Simple."
