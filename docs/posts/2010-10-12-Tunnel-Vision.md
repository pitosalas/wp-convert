This [article by David Brooks in the New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/opinion/12brooks.html>) addresses a
problem that I was wondering about too. New Jersey cancelled the building of a
multi-billion tunnel into downtown New York City. Everyone without exception
says that the tunnel is crucially needed and will benefit New Jersey citizens
enormously. Clearly, New Jersey cancelled the project because it could not
afford it.

I assumed that their position would be something like, we've already laid off
tons of teachers, policemen and so forth, we cannot possibly pay for this, no
matter how important, which seems on the face of it to be a hard to argue with
position. So given that the tunnel is clearly highly desirable and given that
New Jersey legitimately cannot afford it, what's going on? Read this [article
