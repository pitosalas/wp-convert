**Link: [Where can I find non-shrill political coverage?](None):** ""

I read the [New York Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/>), and magazines like
[The Atlantic](<http://www.theatlantic.com/>) and [The New
Yorker](<http://www.newyorker.com/>), and web sites like
[Salon](<http://www.salon.com/>). Each of these, IMO are relatively thoughtful
and interesting and a good way to keep up with what's going on. And I tend to
agree with them often. I guess my liberal bias matches their liberal bias.

I feel like I am not hearing 'the other side'.

What are the counterparts to for example [The
Atlantic](<http://www.theatlantic.com/>) or [Salon](<http://www.salon.com/>)
for the right? Whatever commentary I come across that leans more conservative
tends to be shrill, partisan and impossible to take seriously. I've been
looking at the Wall Street Journal's political coverage which qualifies.

But can someone point me to the conservative equivalent of [The
Atlantic](<http://www.theatlantic.com/>) or [New
Yorker](<http://www.newyorker.com/>) or [Salon](<http://www.salon.com/>)?
