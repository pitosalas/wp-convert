I've come across a flurry of commentary on the fact that apparently TiVo has
added content protection allowing a broadcaster to protect any program as it
is broadcast. The result of this is:

>>

>>> "[A program] recorded with a red-flag next to it (an icon I've never seen
before). When I selected the episode, I got a message to the effect that "the
copyright holder prohibited saving the episode past date mm/dd". (**from**
[PVRBlog](<http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/09/tivo_72_os_adds.html>))

>>

>> Read the [whole
post](<http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/09/tivo_72_os_adds.html>) to see a good
explanation and rundown of what apparently is going on. I'm a TiVo fanatic and
truly hope that they survive. It's a wonderful product which unfortunately is
under pressure and from where I sit is at risk. One other thing. Down lower in
the [post](<http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/09/tivo_72_os_adds.html>) I see
the following **self-righteous** comment which seems always to be the first
**refuge** of people getting upset about any kind of copy protection:

>>

>>> "It treats all TiVo customers like they are criminals with big scary
warnings about what you can and can't do. "

>>

>> **Boo-hoo.** The **louder** people complain about being treated as
criminals. the **biggest** offenders I suspect they really are. I mean I grant
that copy protection or DRM is a pain in the butt, but let's admit that it's
totally within the right of the publisher. iTunes,  Windows XP, and now TiVo.
