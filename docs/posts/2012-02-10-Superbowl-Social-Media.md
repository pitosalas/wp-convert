Here's a really interesting [article about how the Superbowl used Social Media
](<http://socialmediatoday.com/elizabeth-lupfer/440875/exclusive-look-why-
super-bowl-s-social-media-command-center-scores-winning-t>)to enhance the
experience:

> "An exclusive, in-depth look into the Super Bowlâs first ever social media
> command center, the folks who ran it, and how the convergence of technology
> and people created the ultimate online Super Bowl experience." (**from**
> [Why the Super Bowl's Mission Command Center Scores a Winning
> Touchdown](<http://socialmediatoday.com/elizabeth-lupfer/440875/exclusive-
> look-why-super-bowl-s-social-media-command-center-scores-winning-t>))

The article goes into each of the four missions/goals they set out:: Safety,
Service, Capture the experience, Amplification. Interesting that safety is
number one. What they say:

> "With an anticipated 150,000 visitors to descend on Indianapolis, a main
> focus of the social media command center is to ensure public safety. They
> will monitor social media channels for traffic situations, parking
> recommendations, and anything that could be considered suspicious behavior
> or malevolent. Additionally, should a crisis situation present itself, the
> command center will disseminate information for Homeland Security and public
> safety command centers." (**from** [Why the Super Bowl's Mission Command
> Center Scores a Winning Touchdown](<http://socialmediatoday.com/elizabeth-
