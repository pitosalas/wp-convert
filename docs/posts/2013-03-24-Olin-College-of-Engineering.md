I don't know if I mentioned that I'm teaching Engineering Entrepreneurship at
Olin. What a cool school! While the two course have existed at Olin, I was
asked to re-invent them so to a great extent they are new.

Here's a blurb that appeared in the [Boston Globe today that illustrates how
different Olin is from many other
colleges.](<http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/west/2013/03/23/engineering-
for-humanity-needham-olin-college-olin-program-teams-students-seniors-solve-
problems-olin-course-teams-students-seniors-solve-
problems/XynshUPgDeFRUsAgjNCbeO/story.html>) It describes a course called
"Engineering for Humanity":

> "Created by Olin professors Caitrin Lynch, who teaches anthropology, and
> Lynn Andrea Stein, who specializes in computer and cognitive science, the
> course is in its third year with funding from a Healthy Aging grant from the
> MetroWest Health Foundation in Framingham. While Olin previously partnered
> with the Needham and Wellesley councils on aging, this year’s class involves
> seniors affiliated with the Natick Council on Aging." (**from** [Boston
