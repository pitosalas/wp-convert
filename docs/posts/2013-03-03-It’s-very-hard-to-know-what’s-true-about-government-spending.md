**Link: [It’s very hard to know what’s true about government spending](None):** ""



I saw this in the Boston Globe this morning and I jotted it down because yet
again a bit of totally counterintuitive and confusing info:

"The ­defense budget is twice what it was before Sept. 11th…" : Really? Twice
what it was 10 years ago? I can't tell whether that's true but I suppose it's
a number that technically could be objectively determined to be true or false.
The second phrase though: "…and we have half as many enemies." is quite odd: I
suspect there's a lot of subjectivity in that statement making it impossible
to judge true or false.

No wonder I am confuted
