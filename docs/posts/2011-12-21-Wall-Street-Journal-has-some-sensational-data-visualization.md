I don't know if you need [an account to see the amazingly useful, elegant and
well implemented bit of data visualization in the Wall Street
Journa](<http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/polls#cand=Gingrich&race=21&region=IA&src=rcpo>)l.
Typical of a nerd like me, I focus more on the design and technical elements
than the data that it is trying to show. The data, by the way is polling data
sliced in all kinds of ways that are useful and easy to use. Well done WSJ!
