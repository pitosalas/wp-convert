>> Here's a more detailed breakdown of which agency gets what from the  
>  attorney general's press release:  
> State Police - $691,126  
> Executive  
>  Office of Transportation /Mass. Highway Dept. - $45,466  
> MBTA -  
>  $630,396  
> Massport - $8,380  
> City of Boston - $484,590  
> City of  
>  Somerville - $69,113  
> City of Cambridge - $24,794  
> US Coast Guard  
>  - $46,136
>>

>> Of special note: The MBTA will get $132,772 in additional restitution  
>  and $315,198 in "homeland security and community initiative funds."  
>  This is your chance for more green, MBTA. Use it wisely.

>> The [budget for  
>  the movie](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455326/business>) is listed on the
> Internet Movie Database as $750,000.  
>  Even if settlement is a drop in the bucket for Turner Broadcasting,  
>  that's still a hefty marketing campaign budget.
>>

>> The settlement also came surprisingly fast, which suggests that all  
>  parties involved wanted to move on. Boston is embarrassed and Turner  
>  is embarrassed. Neither group wants the words "Aqua Teen Hunger Force"  
>  and "terror attack" tied together in the press anymore.
>>

>> The only unresolved issue involves the fates of Sean Stevens and Peter  
>  Berdvosky. Bostonist says Coakley should let 'em off the hook. She  
>  probably doesn't want those two hanging around the courthouse, anyway.
