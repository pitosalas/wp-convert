I don't know how I [missed this
article](<http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13271891.htm>), but it
sure is an interesting and significant development for one, like me, who was
born and grew up in Curacao.

>>> "Under the new structure, the **Netherlands Antilles will be dissolved**
and Curacao and St. Maarten will become separate, autonomous members of the
kingdom, according to the agreement signed by the leaders Saturday night in
Curacao." (**from** [Miami
Herald](<http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/13271891.htm>))
