If you live in the Boston area and are in the tech business you should check
out the more or less monthly Web Innovators gathering sometimes referred to in
shorthand as WebInno. Here is the [WebInnot
blog](<http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/category/blog/>) and here is the
[WebInno registration page](<http://webinno18.eventbrite.com/>) and
announcement of the next WebInno event.

For all of y'all who suffer from the boston-isnt-as-cool-as-silicon-valley
syndrome, I strongly recommend you check out the next WebInno. Here again are
the coordinates:

> "It’s just over two weeks away until our July 15th Web Innovators Group
> meeting and we’ve lined up another great set of demonstrators for the event.
>
> As usual, the doors officially open at 6:30pm at the Grand Ballroom in the
> Cambridge Royal Sonesta, with the “main dish” presentations to the entire
> crowd starting at 7pm." ( **from**
> [WebInno](<http://www.webinnovatorsgroup.com/category/blog/>))
