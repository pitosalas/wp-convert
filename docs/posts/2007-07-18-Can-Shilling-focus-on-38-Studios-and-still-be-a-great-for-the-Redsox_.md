# [Can Shilling focus on 38 Studios and still be a great for the Redsox?](None)




Far be it from me to comment on sports… In fact this is exactly the first
sports related post for this blog in 4 years.

Anyway, if you follow the Redsox, you know they/we have/had a great pitcher by
the name of [Curt
Shilling.](<http://www.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=121811>) He's well
known by the pitcherati for his heroic performance during the 2004 World
Series.

Lately Curt's become popular among the blogerati for [his personal blog, 38
Pitches.](<http://38pitches.com/>)

So far so good. But did you know that he also heads up a [high tech company
called 38](<http://38pitches.com/38s/>) Studios?

And what's more, [38 Studios is launching with their first public
splash](<http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070717005479&newsLang=en>)
at San Diego Comic-Con 2007. Say what? How about focusing on Baseball, Curt?
