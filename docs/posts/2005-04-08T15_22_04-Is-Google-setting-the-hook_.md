Recently, GMail _raised_ the free storage available to all subscribers to 2
Gig! Amazing isn't it? I don't know how they do it - they must have a
monstrous number of subscribers all over the world. And they are getting
**hooked** , really hooked.

>>

>> Take me for example - I was getting worried when I had about 600 Meg of
archival emails, in about 4 months! What would I do when it filled up? And
then they raised the limit. Talk about **lock-in**!

>>

>> GMail is essential **different** from all other Google services, in that
they are storing personal and private information. It cannot have escaped
Google that they could decide from one day to the next to start charging for
this. It could be very modest. $1 per month? $5.95 per month?

>>

>> Yes there would be the usual **self-righteous** outcry from the
**entitlement** crowd, but I bet perhaps in  6 or 12 months the number of
defections wouldn't be proportionally, that high. And the amount of revenue
would be  **incredible**!
