> "First we need to define free will. In the past, I've defined it as the
> brain's magical ability to make decisions independent of the physical laws
> of the universe. And since I don't believe in magic, or souls, I conclude
> that free will doesn't exist, at least by that limited definition. In my
> view, we're just moist robots bumping around and imagining we have control."
