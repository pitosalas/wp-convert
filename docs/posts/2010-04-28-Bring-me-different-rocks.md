Scott Kirsner summarizes a new book "[Mastering the VC
game](<http://www.jeffbussgang.com/>)" and [re-tells a funny VC
scenario:](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2010/04/new_book_discloses_the_two_phr.html>)

> "He also talks about an exercise called the "rock fetch," when VCs ask an
> entrepreneur to spend time finding other investors willing to join them on
> the investment (bringing them "rocks"), but then decline to collaborate on a
> deal with those investors ("bring us a different rock.")" ( **from** [Scott
> Kirsner](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2010/04/new_book_discloses_the_two_phr.html>))
