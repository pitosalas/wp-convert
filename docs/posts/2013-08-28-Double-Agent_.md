I am reading a really cool book right now: [GARBO: The Spy Who Saved
D-Day](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/155002504X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=155002504X&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://ir-
na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=155002504X)a about a
double agent and an elaborate look behind the curtain of espionage during WW2.
Makes me wonder about the amazing amoung of leaked detail about a missle
strike on Syria.

Could it be a total spoof, and even as we speak, special forces are
infiltrating Damascus and doing their thing? And "whoops" - did I just give it
all away?
