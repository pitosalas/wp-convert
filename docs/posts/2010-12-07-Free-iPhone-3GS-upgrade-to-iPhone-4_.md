So [Radioshack is offering $50 off the price of an
iPhone](<http://gigaom.com/apple/save-up-to-175-on-iphone-at-radioshack/>) 4
for the next several days. As far as I can tell, the difference between the
iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS is not that great, so I've not really been that
interested. But it got me thinking.

It turns out that there are many sites that supposedly give you cash for your
old iPhone. Oddly, Radioshack is offering $125, and I see sites like
[Gazelle.com](<http://www.gazelle.com/>) and
[CashForiPhones.com](<http://www.cashforiphones.com>) offering anything
between $125 and as much as $315. How can that be? I am not sure.

As current AT&T contract lock in is over, so from my calculations: $300 for
the phone, $50 discount from Radioshack is $250, so if I can get $250 for my
old phone, it's a free upgrade. My remaining question is, who the heck is
CashForiPhones.com and can I trust them?
