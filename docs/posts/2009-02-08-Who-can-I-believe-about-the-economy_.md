The problems in our economy right now are real, I believe. Tons of people have
lost jobs, and my investment accounts also prove it. I guess there's no debate
about that. But the question is, what to do about it.

My observations:

  * Politicians on both sides are equally passionate yet totally contradict each other about what they claim to be 'facts'.

  * The most glaring one is, for me, "are tax breaks stimulative or is government spending stimulative?

  * I mean this is a case where apparently intelligent adults are calling the sky red and the grass blue.

  * It's not like they say, "well experts have trouble understanding this but I really believe that the sky is red and the grass is blue". It's more like, "every single expert out there agrees with me, and if you don't you're a dope."

What to do? Here's where I come out:

  * I don't believe any politician, left or right. They are all lying. Ok, they would call it "framing" but the fact is there are no facts (I am a little more inclined to believe the President, but even there…)

  * I know that I can't personally determine whether tax breaks are stimulative or not, or whether government spending is stimulative or not, let alone whether either one will 'work'.

  * I decide to believe experts I whose opinion and prescriptions I read in the newspapers and hear on TV. I look for experts who don't have an axe to grind and seem intelligent, thoughtful, and not a shill for one or the other party.

You may ask, then, what do I read and what do I watch? In the end, the person
who I have decided is making the most sense is [Paul
Krugman](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/opinion/06krugman.html?em>). He
happens to appear in the papers and tv stations I watch. So I side with his
prescriptions:

> "A not-so-funny thing happened on the way to economic recovery. Over the
> last two weeks, what should have been a deadly serious debate about how to
> save an economy in desperate straits turned, instead, into hackneyed
> political theater, with Republicans spouting all the old clichés about
> wasteful government spending and the wonders of tax cuts." (**from** "[On
> the Edge](<http://>)")

and

> "Would the Obama economic plan, if enacted, ensure that America won’t have
> its own lost decade? Not necessarily: a number of economists, myself
> included, think the plan falls short and should be substantially bigger. But
> the Obama plan would certainly improve our odds. And that’s why the efforts
> of Republicans to make the plan smaller and less effective — to turn it into
> little more than another round of Bush-style tax cuts — are so destructive.
> " (**from** "[On the Edge](<http://>)")

And then in the end I also fall back on the common sense approach: "If you
find that you've dug yourself into a big hole, the first thing to do is **STOP
DIGGING** ". Let's face it, we are in a crisis right now, and we know who was
in charge and what policies were in charge to get us here, so I guess it's
time to try something else.
