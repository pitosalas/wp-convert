# [Mint being acquired by Intuit: Good or Bad?](None)




I am a fairly avid fan of Mint.com. So it's with mixed emotions that I read
that [Mint is being acquired by Intuit](<http://www.mint.com/blog/updates/why-
mint-com-plus-intuit-is-a-big-
idea/?utm_source=mint&utm_medium=email&utm_term=blog&utm_campaign=intuit>).
Intuit is a bigger, better known, and so in theory, more reliable vendor for
something that is quickly becoming mission critical for me. But on the other
hand, Intuit's software has become uglier and harder to use over time. I tried
Quicken Online, twice, and found it to be far inferior to Mint. We shall see.

By the way, why do aquired companies insist on saying something like: "Whatâ€™s
not going to change: Mint.com will stay the way you like it: free, easy-to-use
and constantly improving." (this was from their email to users.) It's never
really true, and it worries me because it shows the naivete or dishonesty of
the writer.
