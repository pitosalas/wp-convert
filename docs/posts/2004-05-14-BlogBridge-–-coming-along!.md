It's been quiet but we've been busy. We are getting ready to put up a major
new revision of [BlogBridge ](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)with goodies such as
drag and drop of Channels, Collapse/Expand groups of articles, based on age,
Next Unread processing, a bunch of new User Preferences. Also we are doing a
bit of a reorganization of this site. The 'Tasks' page has become a nuisance
to maintain and really not that useful, so it's gone. And the Specs page is
being totally revised to be more useful. Expect lots of additions to the Specs
page as we move into another phase of development.
