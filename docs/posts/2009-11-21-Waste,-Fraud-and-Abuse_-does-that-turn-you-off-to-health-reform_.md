# [Waste, Fraud and Abuse: does that turn you off to health reform?](None)




An article from Canadian Healthcare Technology notes that [US Healthcare
wastes up to $800 billion a year.](<http://www.canhealth.com/News1252.html>) I
don't disbelieve this article but it doesn't make me not want to start with
healthreform now that it seems possible that it might happen this year, warts
and all. One might even say that that it shows how from the perspective of the
Canadian health system, the US system 'has problems.'

The Massachusetts experience as covered in the press here is that the majority
of the public like it; that it was consciously designed originally to try to
tackle universal coverage and get to cost containment in future revs; oddly
enough I have also heard some say that ER use has not gone down and some say
because there are not enough doctors (or GP doctors or something.)

Here are some other articles that I thought were interesting:

[ Screening Debate Reveals Culture Clash in
Medicine](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/health/20assess.html>)  
[The Wrong Side of
History](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/opinion/19kristof.html>)
