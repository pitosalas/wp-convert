I was looking at the [Apple LED Cinema Display
24](<http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB382LL/A?fnode=MTY1NDA5OQ&mco=Nzk2MDk4NQ>)"
which, of course, looks **gorgeous** in the store. But it's a little expensive
($899, which I was willing to eat.)

Looking at the customer
[comments](<http://store.apple.com/us/reviews/MB382LL/A?fnode=MTY1NDA5OQ&mco=Nzk2NzAyNw>),
they are **glowing** , as **expected**. But there are many that say that the
display suffers from a very short (and specialized) video chord. Not sure how
short is short, but one said "2 inches" (can't be right) and the other one
said it didn't reach the floor from a normal height desk. The other negative
that I saw, which is **no surprise** , is that the built in speakers are so-
so. So I am wavering.

I'd like to find some options for a nice 24″ flatpanel with built in
microphone and camera. **Any suggestions**?
