Long time ago I worked at a company called eRoom Technology where we developed
a product called… eRoom. It was pretty successful and it was bought by a
company called
[Documentum](<http://www.emc.com/domains/documentum/index.htm>), that in turn
was bought by a company called
[EMC](<http://www.emc.com/index.htm?fromGlobalSiteSelect>). Today, on a lark,
I was wondering what had happened to eRoom and I can't really tell for sure.

**Do you know:** did eRoom become [Documentum
Centerstage?](<http://www.emc.com/collateral/software/data-
sheet/h4690-documentum-centerstage-ds.pdf>) Or is that something else?

**Do you know:** does [eRoom](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERoom>) still
exist? Or is the only thing left [eRoom.net](<http://www.eroom.net>)?
