![](https://i0.wp.com/www.xandocosi.com/images/CosiMap2.gif?w=584) Have you
seen this **map** before? Yes?

>> **Actually** it's the map of states where the [Cosi Restaurant
](<http://www.xandocosi.com/>)chain [has
stores](<http://www.xandocosi.com/locator.html>). I don't know what it means,
but I thought it must mean **something**. Amusing.

>> [**Note to those who don 't obsessively follow US Politics and culture:
**the map above looks a lot like the map showing U.S. states where the
Democratic candidate for president won in blue and where the Republican
candidate for president won in red. However the map actually shows where a
certain sandwhich restaurant chain has stores. The relation between the two is
a mystery to me too.]
