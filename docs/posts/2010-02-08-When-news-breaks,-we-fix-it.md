That was the old slogan of [Jon Stewart's Daily
Show](<http://www.thedailyshow.com/>). This morning, while I was in a meeting,
my cell phone reported the following 'breaking news' from
[CNN](<http://www.cnn.com/>):

"- An explosion at a Connecticut power plant near Hartford has caused "mass
casualties," authorities say."

Pretty scary. What was it? What's going on? Well it turns out, now, 6 hours
later, that "at least 5" people died, and 12 injured. Still a serious accident
but how can CNN justify that kind of sensational report sent out on their
'breaking news' text message?

I was talking this weekend to someone with a lot of experience as a journalist
and he said, to my surprise, that news organizations don't even bother 'fact
checking' stories now. Gone are the days I remember from '[All the President's
Men](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074119/>)' when every story had to be
confirmed independently by one, maybe two other sources.
