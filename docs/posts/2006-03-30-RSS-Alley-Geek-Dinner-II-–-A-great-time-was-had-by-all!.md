Last night's event was a **lot of fun**. A ton of energy in the room, people
huddling around comparing notes, even doing some demos. The place was nice and
loud (good) and packed (also good!) **Thanks** again to the co-organizers,
[Bela Labovitch](<http://blogs.opml.org/BelaLabovitch>), [Adam
Green](<http://www.darwinianweb.com/>). Also to the folks at [Top Ten
Sources](<http://www.toptensources.com/toptensources/home.aspx>) and RSS Labs
for sharing their wonderful space with us. If you **missed** this one, **don
't fret**. We'll be organizing the next one soon, somewhere around the
beginning of June. Technorati Tags:
