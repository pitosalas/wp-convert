>
>   * Check out [PicLens](<http://www.piclens.com/mac/>), a Safari-only (so
> far) plug-in. It adds a very cool photo browsing experience to sites like
> Flickr.
>   * Check out [Mashery](<http://www.mashery.com/>), a service that front
> ends other services that offer web APIs. It adds functionality for
> registering users, issueing API keys, etc. It is a service that would be
> offered to other companies that want to provide a web services API to get
> them off the ground more easily.
>   * Check out [IBLOKS](<http://www.ibloks.com/>) a cool web site to create
> mix videos using your media files (images, videos, music.) I played with it
> for a couple of minutes and it looks quite interesting.
>   * Check out [Zoho.com](<http://www.zoho.com/>) a pretty amazing online,
> web based, 'office suite' that actually goes a good deal beyond 'Office'
> including things like Project Management, CRM and other stuff. I am
> impressed!
>   * Finally, take a look at
> [Jangl](<http://www.jangl.com/JanglWeb/Default.aspx>), "Communicate with
> anyone using your mobile phone, without ever exchanging phone numbers," now
> that's a good tag line because it explains clearly what it is.
