>> Here's a sneak preview of something a little bit different. As of the next
beta, we will be running a BlogBridge service off our BlogBridge.com site.
Initially all it will do for you is keep things in synch as you use BlogBridge
on different computers. Keeping in synch means making sure that you have the
same 'favorites' configured and that your unread information is kept
consistent.

>>

>> It does require you to register, by giving us an email address and password
to authenticate you. So that whenever you run BlogBridge it will pick up your
favorites and not someone elses.

>>

>> Oh, and it's free. For now ðŸ˜‰
