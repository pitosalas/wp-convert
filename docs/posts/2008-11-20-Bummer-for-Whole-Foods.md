Not than anyone is buying any stocks these days (are you?) but I happened to
have a very small number of Whole Foods shares, so [this bit of news explains
why Whole Foods have been
tanking](<http://seekingalpha.com/article/105807-whole-foods-in-a-whole-lot-
of-trouble>) (other than the general lowering tide which lowers all boats)

> "… Whole Foods has had a cult like following amongst upscale urban  
> professionals. Aspirational shoppers even mocked their own spending by  
> nicknaming Whole Foods:  “Whole Paycheck”.  Given the economic  
> instability though, customers are staying away from Whole Foods in  
> droves…." (from [Seeking Alpha, Whole Foods in a Whole Lot of
> Trouble](<http://seekingalpha.com/article/105807-whole-foods-in-a-whole-lot-
> of-trouble>))
