[several](<http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/01/14#aTylenolTestimonial>)
[posts](<http://retvig.blogspot.com/2006/01/similar-experiences.html>) on the
wonders of Tylenol. Here's when we really **run out of things** to write
aboutâ€¦

>> Still, it's an opening for a little tidbit that I've had floating around my
head, because, I too, am a **Tylenol fan** (actually not Tylenol itself but
its generic version - Acetaminophen - available in various pharmacy store
brands.)

>> So, Tylenol fans, did you know that [Tylenol overdose is a serious
problem](<http://www.medpagetoday.com/tbprint.cfm?tbid=2233>), and can
actually cause
[death](<http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=629>)? It
can **literally kill you.** And it's [more common than you would
think](<http://www.truthout.org/issues_05/112905HA.shtml>)?

>>

>> Why? Because so many other over the counter medicines that you take for flu
and colds **already** have a strong shot of **Acetaminophen** and so people
lose track of the daily dose that they are actually taking.

>> Check it out.
