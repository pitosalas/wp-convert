Someone asked said to me the other day, 'you're really political aren't you?'
I don't consider myself very political at all, never have been. One a scale of
1 to 10, I'd rate myself a 3. So in a way I have surprised myself in the last
12 months.

I have to say that when I read it, the thought expressed in the quote above
really resonated.
