If you are interested in Game Design you have probably seen this video… I
finally watched it and thought it was really worth sharing. I definitely
recommend it. [Jesse Schell](<http://www.schellgames.com/>) is funny and
engaging to listen to and has great insights to offer. The last 7 or so
minutes is a fantastic riff on how gaming might / will invade our everyday
life in the future. Very plausible.
