Following up [from yesterday's post](</2010/12/07/free-iphone-3gs-upgrade-to-
iphone-4/>), in fact, I was able to get $300 for my mint condition iPhone 3GS
on Craig's list, and was able to buy a new iPhone 4 from Radioshack for $260
after tax!

So, if you have an iPhone 3GS in good condition, and your AT&T contract is up,
then you should upgrade to an iPhone 4 and make $40 in the process. Cool!
