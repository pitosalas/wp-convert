I came across this article a few days ago. [The Ticktock of the Death Clock -
NYTimes.com](<http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/the-tick-tock-of-the-
death-clock/?_r=0>). Yes a depressing topic. The author muses on the wonderful
internet resource [DeathClock.com](<http://deathclock.com/>) which purports to
tell you, to the second, when you will die. Hah Hah funny.

Oddly though the article turns this topic into a positive and constructive
messasge. Once the author sees that according to
[DeathClock.com](<http://deathclock.com/>) he only has 18 years to go, he ups
and quits his job:

> Yes, just like that. Call me crazy. I worked as an editor and, ironically,
> my soon-to-be-former boss had once given me a copy of Malcolm Gladwell's
> "Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking," suggesting I needed to act
> more on impulse than rationality. I had previously underlined this
> particular section: "Decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as
> decisions made cautiously and deliberately.

I skipped by the article online, came back the next day, read it again. Still
I didn't have the 'nerve' to visit [DeathClock.com](<http://deathclock.com/>).

Realizing that 90% of what you find on the web is created by a pimply
brazillian teenager working in the middle of the night (nothing against
pimples) you know that you can't take something like
[DeathClock.com](<http://deathclock.com/>) seriously. Still it took me a few
more days to visit [DeathClock.com](<http://deathclock.com/>). And you know it
didn't depress me at all, it instead served as a kick in the pants to do more
of the things that I love to do, and, as it says in the bible (?) "Don't put
off to tomorrow what you can do today!"

That's my message to you, too.
