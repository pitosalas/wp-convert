**Wonderful Mars pictures? Unavailable!** I was looking around the [Mars Rover
Web](<http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html>) site for some of those
amazing pictures, and to my surprise they are now asking for a password to get
into the ['raw
images'](<http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/spirit.html>) area. I've
got to believe that this is not for security but because their server was
getting totally beat up by people like me browsing around.

first time is a very ligitimate, legal, and useful place where [Bit
Torrent](<http://www.bittorent.com/>) and other clever file sharing
technologies could be used as a force for good ðŸ™‚
