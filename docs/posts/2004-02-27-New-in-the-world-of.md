>> **New in the world of Digital Photography (Demo 2004 Series - 4) **The beat
goes on in the world of Digital Photography. Two very nice (and one less nice)
**Photo Sharing products** were launched at Demo this year. Quick notes on
three of those.

>>  _[PhotoSite from Homestead](<http://www.photosite.com/>)_ **.  **This is a
very nice simple online photo album. It’s customizable and has very attractive
album pages. There is an annual charge, but it’s probably worth it.

>>  _[Share-a-lot.](<http://www.sharealot.com/>)_ This is a different
approach. It’s a very easy, peer to peer sharing of photos with specific other
people. This is a free service, so the question does arise how they make
money. Visually it is less attractive then Photosite. Also you have to
specifically indicate with who you would like to share.

>>  _[Our Pictures](<http://www.ourpictures.com/>)_  is a custom client which
delivers pictures peer to peer to your friends and family. The interesting
thing about the team building it is that they were the people who developed
AOL's "You Have Pictures" service. It shows: the user Interface is very nice.
There’s also a tie-in with the photo retailer to order prints. I think they
got it mostly right. They are providing a different transport to send pictures
because for various reasons email isn't ideal. That's good. However I think
they threw the baby out with the bathwater, because they don't even use email
for notification - they have a separate application and notification method.

across](<http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/D/DIGITAL_PHOTO_SHARING?SITE=OHCIP&SECTION=HOME>)
that goes into more objective detail.
