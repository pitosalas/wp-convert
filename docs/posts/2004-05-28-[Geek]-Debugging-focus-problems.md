**Link: [[Geek] Debugging focus problems](None):** ""

Struggling with debugging hairy focus and other UI problems in Swing (Java)?
Here's a handy little tip that I just found out about:

>>

>> When running a Java application, type Ctrl-Shift-F1 and the VM will dump
the components hierarchy into standard output.

>>

>> p.s. Editorial comment: I question whether I should enter these super-
geeky-limited-interest notes here. In the end, as I am using this blog as my
personal lab notebook I decided that it's ok even though it might put some
people off. My new standard is that I will precede the title with [geek] to
give early warning and allow people to skip it.
