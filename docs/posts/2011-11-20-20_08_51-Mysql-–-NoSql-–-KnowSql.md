A catchy headline, but is it true? "[Facebook Trapped in MySql 'a fate worse
than death'. ](<http://gigaom.com/cloud/facebook-trapped-in-mysql-fate-worse-
than-death/>)This is a quote of what Michael Stonebreaker supposedly said in
this interview article:

> "The widely accepted problem with MySQL is that it wasn’t built for webscale
> applications or those that must handle excessive transaction volumes.
> Stonebraker said the problem with MySQL and other SQL databases is that they
> consume too many resources for overhead tasks (e.g., maintaining ACID
> compliance and handling multithreading) and relatively few on actually
> finding and serving data. This might be fine for a small application with a
> small data set, but it quickly becomes too much to handle as data and
> transaction volumes grow." ( **from**
> [GigaOm](<http://gigaom.com/cloud/facebook-trapped-in-mysql-fate-worse-than-
> death/>))

A few other interesting points and links from the article:

  * Is this case being made as a way for Mr. Stonebreaker to support his own new company [VoltDB which is espousing something they coolly call "New Sql"?](<http://voltdb.com/>)
  * Facebook maintains a [page specifically about how MySql is doing at Facebook.](<http://www.facebook.com/MySQLatFacebook>)
  * An interesting [blog post introducing and further explaining the idea of "New Sql"](<http://blogs.the451group.com/information_management/2011/04/06/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-newsql/>)
