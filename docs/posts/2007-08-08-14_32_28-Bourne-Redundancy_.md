Quick movie review: two movies of more or less the same flavor: [[tag]The
Bourne Ultimatum[/tag]](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440963/>) with heart-
throb [Matt Damon](<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/>) vs. [Live Free or
Die Hard](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/>) with old-dude [Bruce
Willis](<http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/>).

Both good movies (for their genre), but I give the **nod to [tag]Live Free or
Die Hard[/tag]**.

Why? [tag]Bruce Willis[/tag] is funny and [tag]Matt Damon[/tag] (in this
movie, and presumably as intended) has no personality.
