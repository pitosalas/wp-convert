Recently in a conversation I was asked to comment on what really was the big
difference between a **blog** and a **newsgroup**.

>>

>> After all they are both a _reverse chronological list of postings_ , right?

>>

>> My answer, maybe obvious, is this: a newsgroup is (typically) focused on a
certain subject matter, and has many different people posting their comments
and questions on that topic. So you **follow** a newsgroup because you are
**interested** in a specific **subject matter**.

>>

>> A blog is (typically) focused on a certain author's voice, and often covers
many different topics, of interest to the author. So you **follow** a blog
because you are **interested** in a particular **author 's **point of view.

>>

>> Of course in reality it's not quite that black and white, and there are
shades of grey in between.
