The more businesses reward me for showing up at their establishments, the more
likely it will be that a bad guy would want to pretend that they were there to
garner those rewards.

I came across a very interesting paper that proposes the notion of 'location
proofs.': [Enabling new mobile applications with location
proofs](<http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.143.9580&rep=rep1&type=pdf>))

I think something like this is inevitable, but it will have be invisible
because it's too geeky..
