used, but I don't want to freight porting my feeds from one platform to
another with those additional 10000+ rows of data." ( **from**

>> While[ it may make sense to use OPML as a foundation for the format for
Attention
information](<http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/11/an_attention_na_1.html>),
they **are not one and the same** and should not be inexorably bound.

>>

>> In the **world of aggregators** , the one of the original and core use of
OPML was interoperability -- import and export of a user's set of
subscriptions from one aggregator to the next. The **potential
voluminousness** of attention information would harm OPMLs role as the
universal interchange format between aggregators.

>>

>> Now the approach of using an app specific namespace for attention
information is perfectly fine, as long as it is optional, and as long as
aggregators can safely ignore it in cases when it doesn't matter. (I note that
from a purely parochial development effort point of view, this is superior to
a new format such as [XOXO](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOXO>) which
aggregators generally aren't parsing nor generating.)
