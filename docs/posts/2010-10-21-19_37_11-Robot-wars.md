Two very contrasting ways of looking at our **relationship with Pakistan.** I
don't know where I stand, to be honest.

If you are interested in the topic you owe it to yourself to **read both
articles** , because I had a hard time finding an appropriate section to quote
in each case.

[Here is Johann Hari in The Independent, "Obama's Robot
Wars"](<http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann--
hari-obamas-robot-wars-endanger-us-all-2106931.html>):

> "David Kilcullen is a counter-insurgency expert who worked for General
> Petraeus in Iraq and now advises the State Department. He has shown that two
> per cent of the people killed by the robot-planes in Pakistan are jihadis.
> The remaining 98 per cent are as innocent as the victims of 9/11. He says:
> "It's not moral." And it gets worse: "Every one of these dead non-combatants
> represents an alienated family, and more recruits for a militant movement
> that has grown exponentially as drone strikes have increased." ( **from**
> [The
> Independent)](<http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-
> hari/johann--hari-obamas-robot-wars-endanger-us-all-2106931.html>)

At the same time, here's a quote from [Zalmay Khalilzad in a New York Times
piece "Get Tough on
Pakistan"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/opinion/20khalilzad.html?hp>)

> "The United States should demand that Pakistan shut down all sanctuaries and
> military support programs for insurgents or else we will carry out
> operations against those insurgent havens, with or without Pakistani
> consent. Arguments that such pressure would cause Pakistan to disintegrate
> are overstated. Pakistan’s institutions, particularly the country’s security
> organs, are sufficiently strong to preclude such an outcome." (from [The New
> York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/opinion/20khalilzad.html?hp>))
