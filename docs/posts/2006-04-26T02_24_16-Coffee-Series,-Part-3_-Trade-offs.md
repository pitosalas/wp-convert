>> **First** I was an instant coffee guy. Then I got into brewing **whole**
pots, which led to my **wasting** a lot of coffee. Then, my friend
[Charlie](<http://www.championmetrics.com/>) started working at
[Keurig](<http://www.keurig.com/>), and so I got exposed to that machine and
how **wonderful** it was, and one year I got it as a Christmas gift.

>>

>> We still use the [Keurig](<http://www.keurig.com/>) a lot, but truth is
that we've been going through about 10 K-Cups per Day! I was starting to
**notice** that this [wasn't a good deal](<http://www.coffeewhiz.com/>). Not
to speak of the
[Starbucks](<http://www.starbucks.com/default.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1>) card which
I'd been **reloading** from time to time. So you can see, I've worked myself
up (or down) the **evolutionary tree**.

>>

>> Anyway, when I got interested in
[Espresso](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso>), I visited [Williams-
Sonoma](<http://ww5.williams-sonoma.com/>) several times to look at the
different machines. The brand I had heard the most about was
[Capresso](<http://www.capresso.com/index.html>).

>>

>> Without even getting into the **outrageous** price, I was eyeing the
[Capresso Impressa F9, F8 ](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_super_f9.html>)and
so on. All **fully automatic** , meaning you put whole beans and water in
**one end** and espresso comes out the **other end**. Wonderful. However,
being [Keurig](<http://www.keurig.com/>) fans, we had gotten used to being
able to choose from **cup to cup** whether it was going to be caf, decaf,
flavored or what not.

>>

>> A **key obstacle** with these fully automatics for me was that you more or
less had to **commit** to one kind of bean. It's **true** that in addition to
the canister of beans there's a chute that bypasses all that and lets you send
in ground coffee of any kind. But that kind of **defeats** the whole idea and
didn't satisfy me. Plus, there was the **outrageous** price.

>>

>> So I discovered the [Capresso
Ultima](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html>). One way to think of
this is that it's **just like** the fully automatic F9, but **without** the
coffee grinding mechanism. Now that I've used the Ultima a bit it's also clear
that it's a much **simpler** device both mechanically and electronically. And
by the way it's **way way cheaper**.

>>

>> So in the end what swayed me:

>>

>>   1. Less money

>>

>>   2. Smaller

>>

>>   3. Able to change coffee type on the fly
