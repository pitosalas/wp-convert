_(If you are not a BlogBridge you will not find this very interesting)_

>>

>> We notice many of you have requested a BlogBridge account but not activated
it. Here's the thing: once you ask for the account, you will receive an email
with a link in it that you have to click. Until you click, your account will
not be ready to us. (Our instructions need to be improved!)

>>

>> Why activate? Because until you do, the wonderful benefits of the
BlogBridge service will not be available to you!
