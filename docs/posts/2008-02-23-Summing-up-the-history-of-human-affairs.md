In the context of the current Wall Street excitement, I received a letter of
assurance from a mutual fund manager saying, among other things:

> _" Dear Investors, _
>
> _While the recent downdraft in worldwide equity markets may be unsettling,
> there is a great deal in our investments to engender optimism. In fact, we
> believe that we are witnessing an incredible investment opportunity for
> those who are able to exhibit some fortitude._
>
> _We have endured similar experiences in the past._
>
> _If the **history of human affairs can be summed up in simple terms** , it
> would be by the phrase: “This too shall pass.” In our opinion, the current
> crisis will end sooner rather than later."_

I don't know, in **my opinion** a significant part of human affairs can be
summed up in these simple terms:

> _" It seemed like a good idea at the time"_
