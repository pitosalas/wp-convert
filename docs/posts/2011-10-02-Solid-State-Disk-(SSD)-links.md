I've been looking into changing up the primary (and only) disk in my 2 year
old Mac Pro to a Solid State Disk (SSD). Based on what I've seen on the new
Mac Airs I think it will **boost performance a lot** more than adding more
memory would.

The problem is that these beasts are **pretty expensive,** so I am not going
to replace my 400G Hard Disk with a 400G SSD. Instead I will have a much
smaller SSD to boot from and run from, and leave the larger 400G to carry the
load of large files that I don't use a lot.

Here are a bunch of useful links that I have gathered in case you are thinking
of doing the same:

  * [Apple Stack Exchange thread](<http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26441/whats-the-best-way-to-move-from-an-hdd-to-an-ssd-on-a-mac-pro/26456#26456>)
