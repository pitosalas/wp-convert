Ok, that's my own curious headline for this interesting article in the [New
York Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/magazine/15FOB-medium-t.html>):

> "What, after all, is a more recognizable symbol of the capriciousness of
> life than a deck of cards, out of which your fate is randomly dealt? And yet
> here the deck icon is only superficial. At heart itâ€™s not a random-card
> generator but the opposite: a highly wrought program with a memory, an
> algorithm and a mandate to keep children in the game. _An app posing as a
> spatiotemporal object_." ( **from** [The New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/magazine/15FOB-medium-t.html>))
