A few months ago, a friend of mine told me he was struggling, really
struggling with a big career decision. Here's what I told him, and what I
believe and have applied to my own decisions:

> "Try to pay very close attention to what you yourself want to do. It is easy
> to get confused by expectations put on you by others or by yourself based on
> what you think others - parents, friends, colleagues and so on, would expect
> you to do or what the conventional wisdom says is the right thing to do. All
> that is confusing.
>
> You need to try hard to filter that out and find out what you - YOU - really
> want to do, what your heart tells you. It's hard to do but I have found it
> to be a very good exercise. Once you force yourself to be aware of those
> other influences it becomes possible to try to look beyond them.
>
> Second - if you are in a dilemma where two major choices are both incredibly
> appealing, just in different ways, and one moment you think one is the right
> thing and the next moment the other is the right thing - then it's possible
> and likely that either choice would be the right thing and you can't make a
> wrong decision based on all the information you have now.
>
> Thats not to say that a year from now you discover information that answers
> the question, but right now, maybe both choices are equally good."
