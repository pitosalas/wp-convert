>> NASA's Mars Global Surveyor, starting its third mission extension this week
after seven years of orbiting Mars, is using an innovative technique to
capture pictures even sharper than most of the more than 170,000 it has
already produced.

>>

>> One dramatic example from the spacecraft's Mars Orbiter Camera shows wheel
tracks of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit and the rover itself. Another
tells scientists that no boulders bigger than about 1 to 2 meters (3 to 7
feet) are exposed in giant ripples created by a catastrophic flood.

>> Those examples are **available online[here
](<http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2004/09/27/>) and
[here](<http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs>). **In addition, about 24,000 newly
catalogued images that Mars Global Surveyor took between October 2003 and
March 2004 have been added to the Mars Orbiter Camera Image Gallery
[here](<http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/>). These include additional pictures
of the Mars Exploration Rover sites seen from orbit."

>> Amazing, huh?
