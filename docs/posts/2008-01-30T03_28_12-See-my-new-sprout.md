The widget to the left was created using
[Sprout](<http://www.sproutbuilder.com>) - in fact they insist that those be
called "Sprouts" - don't ask me why. Notice how it's spinning and counting
down? It's flash.

[Sprout is a **very cool** service with which I can create widgets which are
actually live Flash scripts that do interesting
things.](<http://www.sproutbuilder.com> "cool flash badges") Sprout will host
them on their servers, and let me link to them with an embed code.

But it gets more interesting. Notice how there's a **share button**? If you
click on that it will show you embed code so you can further put that
(wonderful little) widget on your site too. And it gets cooler still, becuase
there are metrics collected so I can follow these widgets as they travel
through the web. Cool.

I can think of some powerful yet simple things to do with these, like how
about we create some 'i Love BlogBridge' badges, that look cool and get people
to put them on their sites (how? I don't know, but…) And they can be animated
and even include actions which get measured separately.

The possibilities are **great**!
