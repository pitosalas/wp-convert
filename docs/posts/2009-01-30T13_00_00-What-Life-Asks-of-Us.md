A column in the NYTimes that offers a very different perspective from what we
might think of as the goal of a liberal education:

> "Individuals should learn to think for themselves. They should be skeptical
> of pre-existing arrangements. They should break free from the way they were
> raised, examine life from the outside and discover their own values." (from
> [What Life Asks of
> Us](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/opinion/27brooks.html>))

Sounds very common sense. I found myself nodding in agreement, feeling that
this matched more or less how I saw things. But then he introduces a different
view espoused in a book that came out last summer called [On Thinking
Institutionally (On
Politics)](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594512965?ie=UTF8&tag=blogbridge-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594512965>)![](http://www.assoc-

scientist Hugh Heclo.

> "In this way of living, to borrow an old phrase, we are not defined by what
> we ask of life. We are defined by what life asks of us. As we go through
> life, we travel through institutions — first family and school, then the
> institutions of a profession or a craft.
>
> Each of these institutions comes with certain rules and obligations that
> tell us how to do what we’re supposed to do. Journalism imposes habits that
> help reporters keep a mental distance from those they cover. Scientists have
> obligations to the community of researchers. In the process of absorbing the
> rules of the institutions we inhabit, we become who we are." (from [What
> Life Asks of Us](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/opinion/27brooks.html>))

Thought provoking. [Read the
article](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/opinion/27brooks.html>). I am
ordering the book [On Thinking Institutionally (On
Politics)](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594512965?ie=UTF8&tag=blogbridge-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594512965>)![](http://www.assoc-
