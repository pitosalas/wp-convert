I always thought that startups are over glamorized. They are not for everyone.
On the other hand, some people also over stress about the 'risk' of joining a
startup, which I don't by either. Check out: [Alex Payne -- Letter To A Young
Programmer Considering A Startup](<http://al3x.net/2013/05/23/letter-to-a-
young-programmer.html>):

> Maybe a startup is the best way to meet a goal, and maybe it isn't. If the

> I often wonder if they're fitting their goals into the format of a startup
> because it's an approach that's lauded, admired, and easily understood (if
> not easily accomplished).
