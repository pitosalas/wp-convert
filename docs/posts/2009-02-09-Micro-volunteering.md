A very interesting article about [volunteering, and applying the wikipedia
philosophy to
volunteering](<http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33677/information_age_volunteerism_open_sourced_crowdsourced>).
Here he sets the scene:

> "People have a **problem with volunteerism** : Now this statement is
> **provocative**. It's not said in polite company. We like to think that
> we're too busy to volunteer, but it's not true. We don't volunteer because
> we don't want to. Why? Either because we don't care enough about giving back
> to our communities or **today 's volunteer opportunities aren't suited to
> our lifestyles**. Being an optimist, I'm opting for the latter. And so, a
> corollary is required:
>
> Volunteerism excludes most of us: Why? Because it **asks us for a kind of
> time that few of us can give**. We've got a few minutes while waiting for
> the bus to play Texas Hold'em on our mobile phones. We've got an hour to
> watch our favorite TV show on a weeknight. And we've got 15 minutes to read
> Vogue in the dentist's office. What we don't have is two-plus hours on a
> Saturday. That's prime leisure, family, and catch-up time. It's the most
> valuable kind of time we've got. It's expensive. **Volunteerism excludes
> most** of us by asking for something that's beyond what we're prepared to
> give. So we don't."

**This rings true to me**. The rest of the
[article](<http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33677/information_age_volunteerism_open_sourced_crowdsourced>)
proposes some ideas on how to better leverage the bits of time people have
that they might be using to volunteer.

Ben then goes on to describe a project that he is working on called [The
Extraordinari ](<http://www.theextraordinaries.org/>)which is a really cool
idea.

If you are interested in volunteering and the new dynamics there, [read the
article!](<http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33677/information_age_volunteerism_open_sourced_crowdsourced>)It
is absolutely chock full of background information and links to other
projects.

**p.s.** If you have the energy, also read the comments. There are some great
pointers to other resources. I have to say that I feel it is a little
**unfortunate** that this **good post** gets somewhat slammed by some who
maybe don't realize that whether or not these are new ideas, they are reaching
a new audience and putting a new spin on them, and that in itself is positive
contribution that should be applauded.
