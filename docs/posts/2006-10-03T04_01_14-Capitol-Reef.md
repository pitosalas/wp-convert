> Continuing my series about my recent trip through 5 National Parks, here's

> Interesting cocktail party tidbit (if what the
> [rangers](<http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=107>)

> the [Colorado Plateau](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_plateau>)

> Why "Capitol"? Because of the numerous rounded (erosion) white (sandstone)
