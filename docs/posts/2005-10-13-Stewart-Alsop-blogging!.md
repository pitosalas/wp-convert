Alsop](<http://www.stewartalsop.com/>) (the III'd I think), according to his
own **[one-line bio is"venture capitalist and former
journalist/pundit"](<http://salsop.typepad.com/about.html>)** and who I never

blogging](<http://www.stewartalsop.com/>). I **asked his permission** to point

those guys that knows what's happening in the technology world, so let's give
him a huge audience ðŸ™‚ Technorati Tags:
