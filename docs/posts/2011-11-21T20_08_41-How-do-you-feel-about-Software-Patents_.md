I am not dead set against software patents, although I've been on both sides
of the issue.

I am the proud inventor listed on 3 or 4 patents. Some are more worthy in my
opinion that others. I was also leading a development team that had to stand
on its head to avoid conflicting with a patent that everyone agreed should
never have issued, but we didn't have the nerve or resources to contest.

So I was interested to see [some behind the veil of "Intellectual Ventures",
Nathan Myhrvold's IP/Patent
company:](<http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/07/26/138576167/when-patents-
