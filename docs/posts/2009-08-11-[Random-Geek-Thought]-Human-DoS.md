**Link: [[Random Geek Thought] Human DoS](None):** ""



It strikes me that the way speakers are being shouted down at these (now)
famous town hall meetings on health care reform is a form on human '[denial of
service' attack](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack>).

They are taking advantage of a permitted communication (asking a question) to
totally shut down a service (the speaker) by overwhelming the service with
communications, thereby denying service to others in the audience.

By doing it 'loudly' they end up denying service further by drowning out
legitimate requests, by noise and intimidation.

Just a random geek thoughtâ€¦
