# [Zappos Rule](None)




I don't own or buy many shoes. Recently I needed to replace a shoe and visited
my previously favorite shoe store, twice (they had to get the right size from
the other store, or somethingâ€¦) but left not satisfied. This is a really good
store, but they  didn't have what I needed

Also, I found that, like salesmen everywhere, they made up stories to explain
a price differential ("it's more expensive because it has goretex") or tried
to convince me to take an ill-fitting shoe ("you can just cut the toe off the
removable insert and it will be perfect.")

Enter [Zappos](<http://www.zappos.com/>), which I wanted to try for a while.
With their encouragement, when I couldn't decide between two brands, I ordered
both. I received them about 24 hours after I ordered them. They are both on my
feet right now so I can try them in a real world environment (yeah, wearing
two different brands at the same time - real world.) Once I decide, I will
ship back the other paid and, with less effort, and more choice, indeed I am
happier.

[Zappos](<http://www.zappos.com/>): huge selection, free shipping both ways,
good web site, and great (although perhaps a tad too chipper) customer
service. Nice. Too bad I buy shoes only once every 2 or 3 years ðŸ™‚
