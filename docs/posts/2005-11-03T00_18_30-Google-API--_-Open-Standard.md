>> I really like [this idea that Dave Winer has put
forward](<http://www.clonethegoogleapi.com/>): "Let's make the Google API an
open standard", where he says, among other things:

>>

>>> "We've asked for a plug-in architecture for search engines, and if we
can't have that, a solid easy-to-program API is a **pretty good
alternative**."

>>

>> Read the [whole thing](<http://www.clonethegoogleapi.com/>) - there are
some **really good insights** there.

>>

>> Think of it, you could build a "search powered" application. Ok you can do
that now, but you are **limited** to powering your API with Google and no-one
else.

>>

>> What if you could [let the user select](<http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/>) which
search engine to use? Google? Yahoo? Or some upstart whipper-snapper?

>>

>> If you are familiar with the various utilities that exist to make it easy
to post to your blog ([BlogJet](<http://blogjet.com/>),
[Ecto](<http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/>), and so on - there are several but those
two are my **favorites,** ) this is analogous. A general utility, allowing the
user to **choose from several back** ends with different strengths and
weaknesses.

>>

>> Isn't that **cool**? I get a nice graphical UI to post to my blog, whatever
blog service I use. Powerful. And not coincidentally, also enabled by an API
(the **Meta weblog API** ) that Dave put forward some years ago. **Nice**!
