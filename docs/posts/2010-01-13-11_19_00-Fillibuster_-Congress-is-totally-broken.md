Thomas Geoghegan has a fantastic column in the New York Times [explaining the
mess we are in because of the perversion of the fillibuster
rule.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/opinion/11geoghegan.html?ref=opinion&pagewanted=all>)
I don't know how we are going to get out of it, butâ€¦ come on! You should
definitely read the whole thing. Here's a key quote. Doesn't it make your
blood boil?

> "But the Senate, as it now operates, really has become unconstitutional: as
> we saw during the recent health care debacle, a 60-vote majority is required
> to overcome a filibuster and pass any contested bill. The founders, though,
> were dead set against supermajorities as a general rule, and the ever-
> present filibuster threat has made the Senate a more extreme check on the
> popular will than they ever intended" ( **from** [New York Times, "Mr. Smith
> Rewrites the
> Constitution")](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/opinion/11geoghegan.html?ref=opinion&pagewanted=all>)
