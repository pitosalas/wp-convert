Unfortunately students can be quite focused on their grades, and as a result I
end up paying more attention to grading than I would like. By the way let me
point out that 'grading' is more than assigning a grade to a bit of homework.
Without going into detail, you have to decide and communicate:

  1. What all the gradable items of work are (e.g. a programming assignment, a reading assignment, a test, a presentation, a mockup or prototype, etc. etc.)
  2. Your logical scheme for assigning a grade to a work item. That is, what is an "A" for a programming assignment? For a particular presentation, etc.)
  3. What the relative weighting is of each grade is
  4. What formula you use to convert all the individual work item grades to a final grade

And then when you are teaching you have to stick to what you decided and
communicated because you can be sure someone will ask for an explanation.

I just had a converation about this today with some students. So in this
mindset I was amused / intereste to read this article:

[The most commonly awarded grade at Harvard is an A -
Quartz](<http://qz.com/153694/the-most-commonly-awarded-grade-at-harvard-is-
an-a/>):

> "The median grade in Harvard College is indeed an A-," the school's dean of
> education said today, according to the student newspaper. Even more
> stunning: "The most frequently awarded grade in Harvard College is actually
> a straight A."

Now. Harvard will probably say, and maybe reasonably, that it's so hard to get
into Harvard that all the students deserve the grades they get because that's
just _how good they are!_
