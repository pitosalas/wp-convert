Ok, you can tell I like this new gadget builder,
[SproutBuilder](<http://www.sproutbuilder.com>).

I've never had a simple way to create small (or big for that matter) Flash
animations. Yes, I know it makes me regress to stupid jokes form my youth, but
what the heck.

Of interest is that it took me about 5 minutes to make this flash animation
while I was watching the Dems debate. Pretty cool.
