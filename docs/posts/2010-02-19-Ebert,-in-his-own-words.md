A [beautifully written comment (positive) by Roger
Ebert](<http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/02/roger_eberts_last_words_cont.html>)
on the [article about him in Esquire that I mentioned the other
day:](</2010/02/17/roger-ebert-essential/>)

> "Well, we're all dying in increments. I don't mind people knowing what I
> look like, but I don't want them thinking I'm dying. To be fair, Chris Jones
> never said I was. If he took a certain elegiac tone, you know what? I might
> have, too. And if he structured his elements into a story arc, that's just
> good writing. [â€¦] I knew exactly what he started with, and I could see where
> he ended, and he can be proud of the piece." ( **from** [Roger Ebert's
> Journal](<http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/02/roger_eberts_last_words_cont.html>))
