Here's what I think: If economic analysis says that technology does not
contribute to the overall productivity of the country, check the analysis.
It's incorrect.

It's self evident and obvious that technology - computers, smart phones,
tablets, cloud computing, robotics, and on and on make us more productive. I
say, send the economists back to the drawing board to **look again.**
