After attending the [Lean Startup Machine
weekend](<http://boston.theleanstartupmachine.com/>) a few days ago, I pay
more attention to these 'I created this startup in 3 hours' stories. So when I
saw t[his in Inc. Magazine:](<http://www.inc.com/articles/2011/03/how-19-year-
old-daniel-gross-is-taking-on-google-with-greplin.html>)

> "He's an Israeli who sidestepped military service in favor of moving to the

> [www.inc.com](<http://www.inc.com/articles/2011/03/how-19-year-old-daniel-
> gross-is-taking-on-google-with-greplin.html>))

I was intrigued. The headline was even more preposterous: "How a 19-year-old
earned $5 Million to Revolutionize Search" (alternatively to 'Take on Google'.
Well he didn't earn $5 Million, right, it was funding. Also while a cool
product, I highly doubt it is going to revolutionize search or take on google.

From what I can see, [Greplin](<https://www.greplin.com/>), searches through
all of my 'password protected' web sites, for example, LinkedIn, Facebook,
DropBox and so on. It's very simple and just works. I am not ready to declare
it life changing because I don't know yet how often I actually need to search
there, but still, a very interesting product. I would check it out!
