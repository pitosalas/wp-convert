I continue to spend spare time on developing my Android tablet game. As you
may remember from my last post, it involves a top view of a city. I've taken
the time to learn a lot of Adobe Illustrator so I am used slightly more
advanced techniques than last time.

I have to admit that when I walk around town I am constantly noticing the
width of sidewalks, the color of streets, whether there is grass right up to
the side of the building and other silly details.

Anyway, here is what I have so far. How do you like it?
