[Sifteo cubes](<https://www.sifteo.com/games/wordplay>) are similar (except
much more expensive and presumably programmable) to [Scrabble
Flash](<http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/en_US/shop/details.cfm?guid=1584D8B3-19B9-F369-10D2-0A943216A214&product_id=27312&src=endeca>),
that have been around since last year. Interesting.
