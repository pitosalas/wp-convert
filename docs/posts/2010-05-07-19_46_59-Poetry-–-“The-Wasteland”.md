I'm ok with poetry - like it from time to time, but certainly not one of my
main interests. Who knew that [an hour lecture about a single poem, "The
Wasteland" by T.S.
Eliot](<http://feeds.tvo.org/%7Er/tvobigideas/%7E3/GQcMXQHz2xw/004695_48k.mp3>)
could be absolutely gripping and fascinating. Maybe it's the genius of the
lecturer, but even if you could care less about Poetry, this is a fascinating
talk.

By the way it also is a great introduction to my current absolute favorite
Podcast series, ["Big
Ideas](<http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?bigideas_pastepisodes>)",
who present hour long lectures on all kinds of diverse topics, each by a great
speaker who knows their topic, have prepared a well argued and compelling
speech and then deliver it well. I recommend the series! ([The Big Ideas web
site, on the other hand, not so
great…)](<http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?bigideas_pastepisodes>)
