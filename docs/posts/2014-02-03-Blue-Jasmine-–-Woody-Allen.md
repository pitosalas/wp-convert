**Link: [Blue Jasmine – Woody Allen](None):** ""

I just saw Blue Jasmine, the latest Woody Allen movie. It is excellent and I
recommend it. I also happened to read [Nicholas Kristof's column in the New
York Times](<http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-
dylan-farrow/?module=BlogPost-
Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body>)
where he reprinted many of the allegations against Woody Allen repeating
various allegations that make him sound really evil in his personal life. I
also saw the Golden Globes telecast where they showed a montage about his
career and hear Diane Keaton give a speech on Allen's behalf.

Suffice it to say that I was confused about what to believe but biased agains
Woody Allen, even though I continue to love his movies. This article is very
helpful in that regard.
