>> For those of you (like me) who have [lots of
dependency](<http://www.blogbridge.com/>) on RSS, this is exciting (geeky)
news! The [RSS Advisory Board suddenly looks like it's back
alive,](<http://www.rssboard.org/>) with new members and a totally [new draft
specification](<http://www.rssboard.org/rss-draft-1>).

>>

>>> "A new era begins today for the RSS Advisory Board, an independent
organization formed in 2003 that publishes the Really Simple Syndication (RSS)
specification, helps developers create RSS applications and broadens public
understanding of the format." ( **from** RSS Advisory Board)

>>

>> RSS is a really great format and it's been a little neglected recently with
all the attention going to Atom. Only good things can come from this new
development. **Let me know if I can help!
