Check out [this post](<http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/04/26/the-obsolete-
interview/>) from [BuzzMachine](<http://www.buzzmachine.com>):

> The interview is outmoded and needs to be rethought.
>
> There’s no better demonstration of this than the recriprocal snipes we’ve
> been seeing from and around [Wired](<http://wiredmag.com>) magazine from its
> attempt to interview people about Michael
> [Arrington](<http://techcrunch.com>). (If you know the tale, skip to the
> next paragraph.) See Jason [Calacanis’ quite reasonable
> effort](<http://www.calacanis.com/2007/04/24/wired-journo-wont-do-email-
> interviews-ironic/2#comments>) to respond to Wired writer Fred Vogelstein’s
> questions via email and Dave [Winer’s equally reasonable
> offer](<http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/transcriptionErrors.html>)
> to respond in public on his blog. Now see the blunderbuss response from
> Wired in a blog post by Vogelstein recounting the email exchange and his
> dogmatic rules — “I never do email questions right out of the gate…” — and
> also in a blog post from his colleague Dylan
> [Tweney](<http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/04/calacanis_wont_.html>),
> calling Calacanis “cowardly” (it appears to be an awkward attempt to be
> cute) and in an even [clumsier
> attack](<http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/04/alist_blogger_j.html>)
> from Ryan Singel: “What happens when a top tech figure has an online soap
> box, a Silicon Valley-size ego, millions in the bank and a grudge against
> the mainstream media?” Arrington [piped
> in,](<http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=386>) fearing the fuss would cost him
> his publicity. And unable to resist any post about Arrington, [Valleywag
> joined](<http://valleywag.com/tech/silicon-valley-users-guide/interview-
> etiquette-255013.php>) the journalism seminar. Vogelstein — who came to Kofi
> Annan agreement to record an interview with Calacanis — emailed me, too, but
> I told him I was about to blog about this snit and he probably wouldn’t want
> me. Finally, Wired Editor Chris Anderson joined in, saying in a comment on
> Calacanis’ blog, “I don’t impose any one policy.”
>
> But maybe, given your vow of [radical
> transparency](<http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/12/what_would_radi_1.html>)
> at the magazine, Chris, you might want to at least impose openness to new
> ways, or at least an open discussion about the state of the art of the
> interview in the time of the empowered interviewee. A few discussion points:
>
> **Who says that reporters are in charge of interviews anymore?** Why should
> they set terms? They are the ones who are seeking information. As Calacanis
> pointed out in their email exchange, Vogelstein was willing to give up two
> interviews because the subjects would not follow his rules. So the story
> suffers — it’s less complete, less informative, or less accurate — because
> of the reporter’s controlling rules? That wouldn’t make me happy as an
> editor, subject, or reader. If you need the information, shouldn’t you be
> willing to get it however you can? Isn’t that what reporting is all about?
>
> **Are interviews about information or gotcha moments?** Vogelstein said in
> his email that he wants phone interviews to get the tone of the subject.
> Why? If this is about information, what does that really add? Or is it about
> the reporter’s effort to characterize the players in a narrative? Is this
> about information or drama? As a subject, wouldn’t you be wary of that? Or
> does the reporter want to catch the subject in a slip of the tongue? But
> what does that really accomplish? Isn’t it better to get considered,
> complete answers? What’s so wrong with enabling a subject to think about an
> answer, to review it and get it right before sending it? Isn’t accuracy and
> completeness the goal? When I came up in the business, I was taught not to
> review quotes with subjects before publication but now I see magazines doing
> just that; as Valleywag points out, reporters even negotiate quote approval.
> The only reason not to do that is that you don’t want to ruin the gotcha
> moment: ‘You said that.’ ‘Well, I didn’t mean it.’ ‘But you said it.
> Gotcha.’ ‘But it’s wrong, so can’t we correct that?’ ‘Gotcha.’ We’ve all
> misspoken. Should we be able to take back our own words? The only reason not
> to is if the reporter believes he has indeed caught us. And there is a place
> for catching people (George Allen couldn’t take back “macaca”). But in most
> stories, that’s simply not the case, unless your agenda is to get someone.
>
> **Too many reporters get too much wrong.** Listen to what both Calacanis and
> Winer — not to mention veteran [journalist Dan
> Gillmor](<http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/04/24/interviews-email-or-live/>) —
> are saying: They’ve been burned when their words in stories end up
> incomplete or wrong. Gillmor’s right that reporters should be the subjects
> of stories to learn what it’s like to be on the other end of that pen. I’ve
> certainly learned that lesson myself.And by making complete interviews
> public, as Calacanis insisted, even on audio, we get to check the reporter.
> If, again, the goal is accuracy, there’s nothing wrong with that.
>
> **There’s a better way.** Try combining the Calacanis and Winer methods:
> Perform the interview in writing, in public. As Winer
> [says](<http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/transcriptionErrors.html#p4>):
> “So if you want to work together, let’s find a new way to do it. I’m fed up
> with the old system. The way we start the reboot is to do all our work out
> in the open, real-time. Not via email, but in full view of everyone.”
> Examine the possible benefits of this: The reporter asks a question and I
> answer it. But I get it wrong and a reader pipes in to give a correction.
> Isn’t that a better way? I read my answers as I write them and improve them
> myself. What’s wrong with that? Why should the reporter get the opportunity
> to rewrite and edit and I don’t? Why should the reporter get to look smarter
> than the subjects? The best reporters, after all, go to find people who are
> smarter and know more than they do to get the best story. Ah, but I can hear
> some of you saying, wouldn’t this blow an exclusive? Well the
> [exclusive](<http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/04/17/the-value-of-
> exclusivity/>) has a fleeting value of about 30 seconds anymore anyway. And
> what’s exclusive about what Dave Winer has to say about Mike Arrington? If
> anyone owns that exclusive, it’s Dave, no? And Dave’s stance is that if he
> has anything to say on a subject, he’ll say it on his blog. Welcome to the
> transparent era, my fellow journalists. You want transparency? This is
> transparency.
>
> **My words are mine.** Enough said.
>
> **Quotes need no longer be taken out of context.** Isn’t that the greatest
> problem subjects have with how their words are treated? But that need no
> longer be a complaint. Why shouldn’t every quote, every snippet and
> soundbite, link to its context in the fuller interview? If the reporter has
> done a great job on the story, no one need click on those links. But if you
> want more or if you want to investigate the context in which this person
> said this thing, why not make that readily available, now that we have the
> ability, thanks to hyperlinks and permalinks? In fact, doesn’t this change
> the very structure of the story? Why shouldn’t that change, too? I’ve been
> arguing for sometime that online, there’s no reason to insert the standard
> background paragraph when you can link to full background. Ditto for
> interviews. Think of the finished story as a summary, a guide to more
> information. It may give you everything you want. Or it may link you to
> background if you’re new to the tale. Or it may link you to more depth if
> you want to dig deeper. Every story becomes a table of contents to
> knowledge. Let’s not just reexamine the interview. Let’s reexamine the
> architecture of the article.
>
> **Interviews and articles need never end.** And never start. A story can
> begin with a reader’s blog post: ‘I wish I knew…’ Or it can begin with a
> reporter’s blog post: ‘I’m looking at doing a story about ____. What do you
> know? What do you want to know? What should I ask? Whom should I ask?’ Who
> says the reporters should ask all the questions? Shouldn’t the readers?
> Shouldn’t even the subjects (good interviewers usually ask whether there’s
> anything they didn’t ask)? Then the interviews can appear online to be
> challenged, amended, and corrected by writers, readers, and subjects alike.
> Why shouldn’t it be a collaborative effort when it can be? Won’t that only
> yield better information? Then the reporter writes a story. Make no mistake:
> There is still and always will be great value in that. For the vast majority
> of subjects and stories, I don’t want to go digging through original
> material and reporting-in-progress. I want the reporter to do the work of
> packaging it for me. Absolutely. So the article remains a keystone. But who
> says the story should be over then — done, fishwrap — just because the
> reporter’s finished writing it? The story is online and as we see every day,
> it continues to live and grow as people add their knowledge and perspectives
> and corrections via links and comments and remixes of the information. So
> the article isn’t a product. It is a process. It is collaborative. It is
> three-dimensional, linking to background and depth. It’s alive.
>
> **Yes, it is a favor.** Vogelstein said in his email to Jason that “no one
> talks to me to do me any favors.” Oh, they most certainly do. In our gift
> economy, every act of sharing is an act of generosity, a favor. No reporter
> or reader should ever forget that. This is the essential human trait that
> makes the internet — let alone libraries, newspapers, and magazines —
> valuable. Reporters think that they are the ones doing the subjects the
> favor and, indeed, that used to be the case and to a lesser and lesser
> extent, for some, it still is: The reporter holds the key to the presses and
> with the reporter’s choices — ‘I’ll quote you but not you’ — the reporter
> grants attention, publicity, legitimacy. Or that’s the way they thought it
> worked. But this is the essential lesson of the democratization of media: We
> don’t need you and your presses to be heard. Calacanis in his email to
> Vogelstein: “Besides I have 10,000 people come to my blog every day–i don’t
> need wired to talk to the tech industry.” Winer: “Like Jason, I don’t have
> any trouble getting my ideas out on my own.” Or hear the students at
> Virginia Tech who got sick of reporters
> [bugging](<http://www.cybersoc.com/2007/04/virginia_tech_b.html>) them about
> the stories they’d already told on their own .
>
> That should force reporters to reexamine the human economics of the
> interview: because they have to and because they can, because the power
> dynamics of journalist-subject have changed and because they now have new
> tools to do interviews — and articles — in better ways. Why not at least
> try?
>
> Vogelstein wanted to talk to me about Arrington. But I didn’t want to talk
> to him about that. I wanted to talk to him about this. And I just did it, in
> writing, in public. And I hope he talks back and that you will, too. Yes,
> news really is a conversation.
