As you may know, I've been working on launching [**Bootup
Academy**](<http://www.webbootup.com/>), which will offer applied computer
science or engineering programs to college students who want to supplement
their studies with an intensive 10 week summer program. That's why you may
have seen more posts here labeled [EDUCATION].

We're now adding an additional focus, Booting Up experienced technical folks
who have never put together a web or mobile application, have not worked in an
agile environment, and so may not have the right check boxes on their resume.

We think they may be interested in **rapidly bring themselves up to speed,**
develop skills, knowledge, contacts, and importantly, a portfolio of designs
and code, and actual working products. We think that with that they will be
invigorated and more easily make the move into a new startup or innovative
company. And they will stay in **Boston**!

In the New York Times today is an article: ["A Sea of Job-Seekers, but Some
Companies Aren't Getting Any
Bites"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/smallbusiness/even-with-
high-unemployment-some-small-businesses-struggle-to-fill-
positions.html?src=me&ref=business>):

> "Case in point: Gabriel Shaoolian, chief executive of Blue Fountain Media, a
> Web design and marketing company with 85 employees in New York, said he had
> 10 openings right now because his company could not find enough highly
> qualified people with technical backgrounds. “If you’re a professional
> developer, Web designer or online marketing specialist, you can pick the
> company you work for,” Mr. Shaoolian said. “There is a shortage where demand
> severely outstrips supply.” ( **from** [The New York
