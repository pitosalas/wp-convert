[Dave Winer makes a
point](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/02/03#When:7:09:19AM>) which I
**totally** agree with: it is **important** to **learn** from what has come
**before** - or more more provocatively - to steal good ideas wherever you can
find them. And **secondly** that the only way to do that is to make it a point
of being very familiar with other products, other approaches.

>>

>> As a designer of software I certainly **believe in that**. In fact,I have
**lived** that over and over again:
[Improv](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Improv>) learned from 1-2-3,
[eRoom](<http://www.documentum.com/eroom/>) learned from Lotus Notes, etc. And
similarly, [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>) has begged, borrowed and
stolen from all sorts of other applications, including NetFlix, Del.icio.us,
Wiki's, numerous email clients and on and on. And not by accident but by
conciously studying what others have done.

>>

>> That said, there are certain design choices which you can't straddle: they
are fundamental - you have to pick. To bring it home with an example, many
people far prefer web based aggregators (like
[Bloglines](<http://www.bloglines.com/>)) over client based aggregators (like
BlogBridge.) Each brings their advantages and will appeal to a certain subset
of users, and this is **important** : they will be a turn-off for another
subset of users.

>>

>> As a designer you have to **make such choices** while knowing that you will
**alienate** some of the users you would hope to get, but **counting** on the
fact that there is enough **diversity** in taste and work style to allow more
than one model succeed.
