>> Doc [comments with grudging admiration
](<http://doc.weblogs.com/2005/04/11#someOfTheNewsThatsFitToShare>)that IBM
has [decided to give
away](<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/11/technology/11ibm.html?ex=1270872000&en=dbc95a2028b33bbe&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland>)

there is no economic benefit to having those patents, that's a lot of money
down the shute.

that the PR value of _**open sourcing**_ these worthless patents might
