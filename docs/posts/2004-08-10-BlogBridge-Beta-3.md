>> We just put up **BlogBridge Beta 3**. Check it out. It's got many neat new
features, most particularly the **BlogBridge Service** which I wrote about
recently.

>>

>> Here are the **key links of interest** :

>>

>>   * [BlogBridge Beta Download](<http://www.blogbridge.com/download.htm>)

>>   * [BlogBridge Website](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)

>>   * [BlogBridge Feature List](<http://www.blogbridge.com/featurelist.htm>)

>>   * [Stories about the BlogBridge Service](</weblogs/archives/000464.html>)

>> BlogBridge has reached the functionality now that **it is my main Blog
Reader**. It's **more buggy than I would like** , but that's the nature of a
beta, I guess.

>>

>> Finally the foundation is there for us to build some of the neat new ideas
we've been talking about, like **" Show only good articles".** Hmmmm. Clever
trick!

>>

>> **And let me know what you think!**
