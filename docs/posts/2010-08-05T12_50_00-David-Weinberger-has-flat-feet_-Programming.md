David Weiner, author, speaker, thinker, turns out to be a programmer too! Read
his musings of what it's like being a flatfooted programmer.

But the reason I really cite this is because it reminds me of [Google's new
tool to easily create applications for Android. It's called
AppInventor](<http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/>). I've studied it a
little. It looks interesting and cool but it raises in me an old bias against
visual programming environments.

Take a [look at this out of context screen shot.

wonder whether you can really program visually. I think it was [Dave
Winer](<http://www.scripting.com/>) who said years ago that programming is
more like writing and less like drawing. I think I agree.

I wonder what the flat footed developer corps thinks. Does Visual Programming
help?
