It's **hard to believe** , but here is what I got from Mint.com when I asked
why my Bank of America info was not updating on Mint:

So, **Mint.com no longer supprts Bank of America accounts**. Isn't Bank of
America one of the biggest (or THE biggest US bank?)

I am most certainly not having a nice day. Time to move on from Mint.com.
