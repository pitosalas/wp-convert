Bloggers and others are notoriously  obcessed with metrics: how many hits,
what's my rank etc. As a result there are numerous services which try to
analyze sites and blogs etc, to help measure this. Not insignificantly, a
site's revenue potential is tied closely to this as well.  [Seomoz.org has put
together a pretty interesting study](<http://www.seomoz.org/articles/search-
blog-stats.php>) doing a somehwhat empirical analysis of this question.
