(**Web site except:** Under the Tobin Bridge, through the Amelia Earhart Dam, passed the beautiful Amsterdam-esque canal of Medford, and opened up to the Mystic Lakes. This is our boat trip throughout the upper and lower Mystic with officer Patrick Johnston. Hopefully we'll use bits of this in the final 8-10 minute video we're making for The Mystic River Watershed Association. Music: Balmy Night by Department of Eagles Group Members: Kelly Wessel, Chris Bianrosa, Julie Hook & Sarah Ginsburg)
