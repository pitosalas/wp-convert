>>

>> I'm a big fan of Wikipedia, and of course traditionally (like anyone) have
been an admirer of the Encyclopedia Britannica.

>>

>> Recently the highly respected magazine Nature [published an
article](<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html>)
describing a study in which they compared the two and found only slightly
fewer inaccuracies in Wikipedia than in Britannica.

>>

>> "The exercise revealed numerous errors in both encyclopaedias, but among 42
entries tested, the difference in accuracy was not particularly great: the
average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies;
Britannica, about three." ( **from** "[Internet Encyclopedias go head to
head](<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html>)")

>>

>> Of course, Britannica is not about to take this sitting down. [This is from
their web site](<http://www.britannica.com/>):

>>

>> "Recently, the science journal Nature published a study of online
encyclopedias. It was misleading and wrong from top to bottom, and in a
thorough analysis of the evidence by our editors and their outside advisors we
explain why the study was invalid and should be retracted." (from [Britannica
Web Site](<http://www.britannica.com/>))

>>

>> All this was covered in the Boston Globe this morning. Interesting.
