>> Guy Kawasaki writes a nice little bit about VCs (some of my best friends
are VCs) and about entrepreneurs. It rings very true to me. Here's some of
what he says:

>>

>>> "Venture capitalists are simple people: we've either decided to invest,
and we are convincing ourselves that our gut is right (aka, "due diligence")
or there's not a chance in hell. While we may be simple, we're not necessarily
forthcoming, so if you think it's hard to get a "yes" out of venture
capitalist, you should try to get a conclusive "no.""

>>>

>>> "Alas, entrepreneurs are also simple people: If they don't hear a
conclusive "no," they assume the answer is yes." ( **From** "[Let the good
times roll by Guy
Kawasaki](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_top_ten_lie.html>)"

>>

>> Read the [whole
thing](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_top_ten_lie.html>). It's well
written, humorous and contains some really good advice!
