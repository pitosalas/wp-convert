**Link: [RSS Feed Advertising](None):** ""

From News.com, about [Kaboodle BrightAds
RSS](<http://news.com.com/Firm+eyes+RSS+feeds+as+ad+vehicle/2100-1024_3-5591056.html?tag=cd.top>)

>>

>>> On Monday, the company introduced a self-service system that lets online
publishers pair advertising with their RSS feeds. Called BrightAds RSS (after
the technology format known as Really Simple Syndication), the service takes
advantage of Kanoodle's keyword advertising system to match Web content to
relevant ads. Once a publisher signs up, an advertising link will piggyback on
its syndicated feed sent to third-party news readers.

>> Echo's of the [Google Toolbar
debate?](<http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1766764,00.asp>) It sounds like
Kanoodle BrightAds RSS will create and host RSS feeds for their customers, and
intersperse Ads in the feeds. I am **not sure** this is a **good idea** , but
I suppose it was **inevitable**.

>>

>> The **question** is, will the inserted ads be distinguishable so that an
aggregator could **strip them out**?
