No less an authority as the **Freakonomics dudes** offer an article about "[A
Call Girl's View of the Spitzer
Affair"](<http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/a-call-girls-view-
of-the-spitzer-affair/>) Read this Q & A and many more like it.

> "Q. Have you ever had a client as powerful or well-known as Eliot Spitzer?

> A. I have clients that are professional athletes,artists, and entertainers.
