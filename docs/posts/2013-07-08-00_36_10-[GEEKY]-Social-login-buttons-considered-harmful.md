You probably don't know what a social login button is so forgive this bit of
geekyness. I am sure you've seen them: "login with facebook or twitter?" If an
app or a site wants to "save you the trouble" of registering a username and
password, they may "make your life easier" by allowing you to register using
your facebook or twitter password. Conventional wisdom in the world of apps
has been that this is a user requirement, and plus beneficial to the business
as well. Here's an interesting article that refutes that belief, at least in
certain significant scenarios.
