**Link: [“We might as well have a good time while we’re here, don’t you think?”](None):** ""

This is from a play we saw last year at the [Huntington
Theatre.](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org>) The play is [Prelude to a Kiss
by Craig Lucas](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_a_Kiss_\(play\)>). It
[production was quite good
but](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/0910/prelude/multimedia.aspx>)
this particular speech struck me as the best part of the play. Don't read it
as depressing just as really good writing and really true.
