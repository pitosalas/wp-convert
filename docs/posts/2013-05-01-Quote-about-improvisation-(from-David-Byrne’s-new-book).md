**Link: [Quote about improvisation (from David Byrne’s new book)](None):** ""



I picked up David Byrne's new book: [How Music
Works](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936365537/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1936365537&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1936365537) while waiting around
in a bookstore. I flipped it to this page with this quote which I thought was
quite cool. If I remember he was quoting something else. Anyway, I wonder how
this general idea can be adapted to other forms of improvisation, like
designing software products or teaching. I am thinking. Do you have an idea?
