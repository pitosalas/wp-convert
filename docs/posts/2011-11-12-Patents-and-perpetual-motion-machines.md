An [interesting commentary on a couple of patents that issued from the US
Patent Office:](<http://gailly.net/05533051.html>)

> "The US patent office no longer grants patents on perpetual motion machines,
> but has recently granted at least two patents on a mathematically impossible
> process: compression of truly random data" ( **from**
> [Gailly.net](<http://gailly.net/05533051.html>))

Also you might be interested in the topic, [there's a second patent that seems
also to be fatally flawed](<http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-

I am not opposed to software patents as a matter of principle. And of course a
patent that describes something that is mathematically impossible is harmless
inasmuch no one is forced to use it. But it does shine a light on the problems
with Patents in general. Is it mathematically impossible though?

I wonder how the inventors of these patents would respond to the allegations
above. Well it turns out that he has devoted a whole web site to the topic:
["Michael Cole, Inventor of Recursive Data Compression Patent 5,488,364
created andy utilized a recursive data compression
structure."](<http://www.nonarithmetic-operations.com/>) The site has lots of
details and mathematical symbols. I have not taken the time to try to
understand either his arguments or the counter arguments.

I mainly got fascinated by the conflict.
