An interesting international perspective on politics:

> "…So, believe me, US politics don’t have a Left. Looking at the presidential
> candidates, I am frankly appalled. None of them would be a viable politician
> in Sweden. They all support the death penalty, none advocates strict gun
> control and all make frequent mention of their religious beliefs in public.
> These are extremist stances. Not even the tiny Christian Democrat party
> mentions God publicly in Sweden, for fear of alienating the pragmatic
> rationalist majority…." ( **from**
