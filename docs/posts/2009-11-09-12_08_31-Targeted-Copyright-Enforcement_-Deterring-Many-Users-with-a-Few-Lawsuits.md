[The post](<http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/targeted-copyright-
enforcement-deterring-many-users-few-lawsuits>) links to an [article which
explains a 'scheme' to still be able to deter
infringers](<http://www.pnas.org/content/106/34/14230.full.pdf>): basically,
the enforcer tells the world that they will sue the infringers alphabetically.
In other words, the one whose name (or other ID) starts with an "a" will get
sued first.

Well this is supposed to deter the "Ables" and "Andersons" and so on, which
now will put the "Bakers" and "Bozos" at risk, and so on.

Sounds kind of like the [hangman's
dillemma.](<http://www.mheap.com/puzzle2.html>)

Do **you** think it would work?
