**Link: [GPT-4 is 82% more persuasive than humans, and AIs can now read emotions](https://newatlas.com/technology/gpt-persuasion-manipulation/):** "GPT-4 is already better at changing people's minds than the average human is, according to new research. The gap widens the more it knows about us â€“ and once it can see us in real time, AI seems likely to become an unprecedented persuasion machine."

Ouch. This is not a happy development. I worry about our highly polarized, super conflicted, manipulated and confused society. This aint gonna help.
