I **love** this article. It's by an [actual author ](<http://tim-
parks.com/>)talking about whether it matters if a reader reads a book through
to the very end.

He starts with the basics, claiming that serious (' **mature** ') readers
don't feel self-imposed pressure to read a book to its very last syllable:

> "It seems obvious that any serious reader will have learned long ago how
> much time to give a book before choosing to shut it. It’s only the young,
> still attached to that sense of achievement inculcated by anxious parents,
> who hang on doggedly when there is no enjoyment. “ ( **from** [Why Finish
> Books)](<http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/mar/13/why-finish-
> books/>)

**Agreed**.

He then gets into much subtler ground: what the experience is of the author or
writer in **deciding** whether it's time to **wrap things** **up** and bring
the story (and the book, not always the same thing) to it's conclusion:

> "Kafka remarked that beyond a certain point a writer might decide to finish
> his or her novel at any moment, with any sentence; it really was an
> arbitrary question, like where to cut a piece of string, and in fact both
> The Castle and America are left unfinished, while The Trial is tidied away
> with the indecent haste of someone who has decided enough is enough.“ (
> **from** [Why Finish
> Books)](<http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/mar/13/why-finish-
> books/>)

The article has several other **neat scenarios** and examples and ends with
this, from the point of view of the author himself:

> "And finally I wonder if it isnât perhaps time that I learned, in my own
> novels, to drop readers a hint or two that, from this or that moment on,
> they have my permission to let the book go just as and when they choose." (
