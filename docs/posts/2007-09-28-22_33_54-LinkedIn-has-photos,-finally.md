Finally, [welcome to the 20th  century,
[tag]LinkedIn[/tag]](<http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/27/picture-this-
linkedin-adds-profile-photos/>):

> "It’s taken four years for LinkedIn to add photos, when every other
> [tag]social network[/tag] has done it forever. The site for business
> professionals has always kept a conservative, business-like tone. But
> although it says the decision has been driven by members, LinkedIn could not
> have escaped noticing that business people are using sites like Facebook to
> network both personally and for business. Adding photos ticks a box marked
> ‘we can be as friendly-looking as Facebook too guys’."
