[Eric Ries ](<http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-ries>)is locally famous as
being one of the strong promoters of the [Lean
Startup.](<http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307887898/?tag=blogbridge-20>)

He writes an [excellent and courageous article that explores why it is that
there seem to be **many more white males** starting new technology companies
than other genders, races, and
nationalities.](<http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/racism-and-meritocracy/>)

I say courageous because no matter what one says about the topic, he (or she)
is sure to be attacked by some corner.

It's a thought provoking article.
