**Link: [Geometry (Points, Vectors and Normals)](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/mathematics-physics-for-computer-graphics/geometry/points-vectors-and-normals):** "Lesson summary: In this lesson we will learn about the concept of point, vector, normal and matrices. These concepts are used everywhere in CG, whether in modelling, simulation, animation or rendering. They are the essential ingredients of any graphics application."
