I really like [this idea that Dave Winer has put
forward](<http://www.clonethegoogleapi.com/>): "Let's make the Google API an
open standard", where he says, among other things:

>>

>>> "We've asked for a plug-in architecture for search engines, and if we
can't have that, a solid easy-to-program API is a **pretty good
alternative**."

>>

>> Read the [whole thing](<http://www.clonethegoogleapi.com/>) - there are
some **really good insights** there. Think of it, you could build a "search
powered" application. Ok you can do that now, but you are **limited** to
powering your API with Google and no-one else.  What if you could [let the
user select](<http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/>) which search engine to use? Google?
Yahoo? Or some upstart whipper-snapper?  If you are familiar with the various
utilities that exist to make it easy to post to your blog
([BlogJet](<http://blogjet.com/>), [Ecto](<http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/>), and so
on - there are several but those two are my **favorites,**) this is analogous.
A general utility, allowing the user to **choose from several back** ends with
different strengths and weaknesses.  Isn't that **cool**? I get a nice
graphical UI to post to my blog, whatever blog service I use. Powerful. And
not coincidentally, also enabled by an API (the **Meta weblog API**) that Dave
put forward some years ago. **Nice**! Technorati Tags:
