**Link: [Why is everything free?](None):** ""

Have you noticed how man how many new apps that have appeared of late are
available **free of charge**? Web 2.0 services like
[gada.be](<http://gada.be/>) or [flickr](<http://www.flickr.com/>) or
[del.icio.us](<http://del.icio.us/>). And more conventional client apps like
[Firefox](<http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/>)? The list is approximately
infinite. They **come and** go at an amazing rate. And they are all **free**.
Not only are they free, **users** seem to _expect_ them to be free. I am **not
sure** how this came to be… Is it a **unintended consequence** of the open
source philosophy? Is it a **incorrect reframing** of the fact that major and
well known services like google and yahoo are (**apparently**) free (although
ad supported?) Whatever the reason, I worry about the **chilling effect** this
can have on innovation in our industry.  **How many** great new innovations
have **died on the vine** because there was just no way for the creators to
**pay the rent** while building the **Next Big Thing**? Even after a year, two
years of development, the **prospects** for getting users to somehow
compensate for the value delivered were small to **none**.  Is there
**another** explanation?  What if this was a pure **supply-demand** invisible
hand phenomenon? What if the **platforms** on which these systems are built
(Apache, Tomcat, PHP, MYSql, Java, and so on) have become so rich and so
**powerful** that it has become _comparatively_ very **cheap** to build
wonderful innovative systems like [Furl](<http://www.furl.net/>),
[Rollyo](<http://rollyo.com/index.html>) or [Reddit](<http://reddit.com/>),
and therefore the market was valuing them correctly at zero dollars. (My
friend [Shimon Rura](<http://frassle.rura.org/Directory/index?feed=1>) put
forth a case along those lines the other day. ) While there's an **element of
truth** in this second explanation, I believe it is only a small part of the
story. I continue to believe that this tendency to expect stuff to be free has
had a chilling effect on innovation in our industry. <!-
