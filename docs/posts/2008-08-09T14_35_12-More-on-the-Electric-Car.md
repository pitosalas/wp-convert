After an [interesting comment](</2008/08/06/who-killed-the-electric-car-and-
why-wikipedia-is-great/#comment-41711>) on [my previous post on Electric Cars
topic, "Who Killed the Electric Car"](</2008/08/06/who-killed-the-electric-
car-and-why-wikipedia-is-great/>) suddenly I am seeing stuff about this topic
all over the place.

Here's a great article from the current Atlantic Monthly about GM's new shot
at electric car fame and fortune (hopefully)

> "Still, he hesitated. GM had called him because of his deep experience with

Does cast another light on the whole EV-1 story. Now I want a
[**Volt**](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt>)!
