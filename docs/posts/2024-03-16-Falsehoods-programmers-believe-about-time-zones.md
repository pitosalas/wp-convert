**Link: [Falsehoods programmers believe about time zones](https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/):** "I decided to make a time zone converter. It had seemed like an easy project, but I was horribly mistaken"

I always enjoy articles with misconceptions. Timezones is one of those boring topics that drive programmers crazy and eat up a disproportionate amount of coding time!
