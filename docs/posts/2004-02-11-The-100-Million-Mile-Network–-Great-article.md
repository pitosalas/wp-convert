[The 100-Million-Mile
Network](<http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1522553,00.asp?kc=EWNWS021004DTX1K0>)
- Great article about one of my favorite topics, the Mars Rover. There are
[several really interesting blogs](<http://athena.cornell.edu/news/>) about
this project as well, [that I'd recommend](<http://www.martiansoil.com/>) for
the space buffs among you!
