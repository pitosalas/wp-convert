>> **Stewart Alsop " the best political columnist of the past century":
**Well, that's high praise from [William Safire in a New York Times
editorial](<http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/15/opinion/15SAFI.html>) today.
Stewart of course has been known as a technology columnist, author of a great
Tech newsletter **" PC Letter",** and inventor of the **" Vapor List"** where
he tracked software vendors' promises against reality. Stewart has since gone
to the **dark side** and the world of Venture Capital.

>> What I never knew was that Stewart had been, apparently, a **political
columnist of some note!**

>>  **Correction:** In fact, the reference by Safire was to another Stewart
Alsop, the father of the Stewart Alsop that I know and I mention above. Oops.
Stewart Alsop the elder in fact was a political columnist of some renown until
he passed away in  1974.
