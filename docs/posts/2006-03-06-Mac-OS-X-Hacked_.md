>> This is only a **little** funny because Mac fans (and I am one of them) can
be **very smug** about OS X security, saying things like: "There has been not
a single case of a virus on Mac, ever." Hard to prove or disprove but
intuitively it's kind of hard to believe.

>>

>> So when I saw commentary somewhere earlier today that Mac OS X was **hacked
in less than 30** minutes I hesitated to post about it, thinking that it was
yet another urban legend.

>>

>> But now ZDNet has picked it up, and with raised eyebrows and a smile (or is
it a **smirk**?) on my face, I share the link to an article I just saw:

>>

>>> "Gaining root access to a Mac is "easy pickings," according to an
individual who won an OS X hacking challenge last month by gaining root
control of a machine using an unpublished security vulnerability." (
**from**["Mac OS X Hacked in less than 30
minutes"](<http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-6046197.html?tag=nl.e589>))

>>

>> Can it be **true**?
