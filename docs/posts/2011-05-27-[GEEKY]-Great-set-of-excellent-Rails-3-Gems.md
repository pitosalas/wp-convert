Just a quick read of this post showed me several great gems that I want to try
right away! If you're a Rails programmer this is going to be of great
interest: [Rails 3: Fully
Loaded](<http://intridea.com/2011/5/13/rails3-gems?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email>)

[ActiveAdmin](<http://activeadmin.info/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email>)
is particular looks like an excellent new way to generate a whole suite of
reasonable views and controllers to create, read, update and delete
information in Rails3 applications.
[ActiveAdmin](<http://activeadmin.info/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email>)
is customized with a DSL so that you have a prayer of getting what you want
without hacking the hell out of the logic that is built in. I will definitely
try it.
