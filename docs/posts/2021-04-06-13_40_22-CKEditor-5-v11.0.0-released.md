(**Web site except:** We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v11.0.0. This version brings a few new features (the block toolbar, the autosave plugin, Electron support), many improvements (typing on Android, selection stability and selection handle for tables) and an upgrade to webpack 4. Read on!)
