**Link: [Jade Rubick - Don’t use goal frameworks to manage projects](https://www.rubick.com/advice-for-using-goal-frameworks/?utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Don%27t%20use%20goal%20frameworks%20to%20manage%20projects%20-%204537177):** "Goal frameworks like OKRs are a popular way to coordinate the work across an organization. One of the most common anti-patterns is to use it to run projects in engineering. This describes why that is a problem and better alternatives."

Interesting views on various schemes for thinking about goal setting (often including measuring success at meeting them). One that I’ve heard of before is “commander’s intent” which is a succinct way to bring the “commander”s (in business this would probably be the person two levels up, or perhaps the department manager or similar) intent into the conversation.
