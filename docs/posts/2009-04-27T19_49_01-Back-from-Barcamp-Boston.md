This weekend I had a chance to attend BarCamp Boston (4). As usual it was fun
and interesting and I had a chance to hang out and talk with a bunch of
interesting people.

If you don't know how a Bar Camp works, it is of the genre of "Unconferences"
and one of the keys is that it has no program, ahead of time.

Kind of a leap of faith, you know? Anyway, the image to the left (and click on
it to see the enlargement) shows how at the end of the meeting the program is
fully visible, and actually quite interesting! Click on it to see a big
englargement.

Also for the first time, I got up the nerve to do a session on Voting
Technology, my current focus area.

And here is a closeup of my brilliant bit of marketing for my session. The
checkmarks are how other attendees indicate their interest in a topic, which
is how it ends up on the board. I think I had about 10-15 people participate.
It was cool.
