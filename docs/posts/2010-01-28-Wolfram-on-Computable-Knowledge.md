[Stephen Wolfram](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram>) is a
[genius](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius>). (Ok, he's also a bit
grandiose, self-promoting and arrogant, but I think he's amazing. Kind of like
I feel about [Ray Kurzweil](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_kurzweil>),
another genius IMHO.)

[Wolfram|Alpha](<http://www.wolframalpha.com/>) is his latest product, and
it's a fascinating experiment. I can only imagine the work that has gone into
it, both the Mathematica foundation and the data collection, cleansing and
organization. In my own experimentation with the site, I have had mixed
results. It's still growing up. I see the promise, and I am rooting for it.
But for now it isn't that useful, for me, anyway.

[Wolfram has written a very long and interesting treatise on Computable
Knowledge](<http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/06/29/stephen-wolfram-on-the-
quest-for-computable-knowledge/#more-1784>) as he calls it. I won't try to
excerpt or summarize it. For people interested in mathematics and computation,
or in Stephen Wolfram himself, it's [worth
reading](<http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/06/29/stephen-wolfram-on-the-
quest-for-computable-knowledge/#more-1784>). I really enjoyed it.Technorati
