**[Channel Dean](<http://archive.scripting.com/2004/01/19#channelDeanDay>):
"An RSS **[**feed**](<http://xml.deanforamerica.com/channelDean.xml>)**that 's
like a clipping service for people interested in US politics." **[Dave Winer
and some co-
conspiritors](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/howChannelDeanCameToBe>) have
created something really cool: a new feed which brings together a series of
feeds that all relate to US Politics. As I've said before, **hats off** to
these kinds of innovation. **I 'm just loving it**! [Here's the RSS (XML)
link](<http://xml.deanforamerica.com/channelDean.xml>) if you want to try
it.This development raises some interesting questions/ideas:

>>   * What is the Dean-bias of this feed? Is it in fact a feed for _people
interested in US politics_ or one for _Dean Supporters interested in US
Politics_. And with the subtlety of marketing and political campaigns these
days, how do I even tell the difference?

>>   * It's pretty cool to see CNN articles right next to BBC, Salon, AP and
NYT articles. For me, as a reader, it's exactly what I want. How do the
content providers feel about it? Is this anything new with respect to
intellectual property and copyright?

>> Keep 'em coming. This is what makes this space ("this" = RSS, Blogging,
Syndication, etc.) so exciting.
