**Link: [The Impending Flash Crisis?](None):** ""

An interesting article about this [impending
crisis.](<http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/>) Although it's impending, I had never
heard about before, despite the claim that "This impending “flash crisis” is
well known in system circles. It’s almost like a mini Y2K." Ok, tell me more…

The core does make a great point:

> "What happens when you blow up the “slow disk” assumption is that your
> entire software stack begins to crumble. When the cushion provided by those
> 10 ms of seek time goes away, CPU becomes your bottleneck. You have to start
> rethinking a lot of design choices." (from [Impending Flash
> Crisis)](<http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/>)

Interesting…
