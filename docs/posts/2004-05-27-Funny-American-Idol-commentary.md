Yes, I guess some of you have never seen American Idol, so you wouldn't
appreciate this ironic and funny commentary:

former idol, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and John Kerry could stand up,
holding hands, trembling but beaming encouragement to each other, as Ryan
announced our next American president. "
