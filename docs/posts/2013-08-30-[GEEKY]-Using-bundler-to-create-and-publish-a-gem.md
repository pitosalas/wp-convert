A really useful link. For Ruby programmers only.

[Jorge Coca | [HOW-TO] Build a Rails gem with Bundler - Gumby
Framework](<http://www.jorgecoca.com/articles/how-to-build-a-rails-gem-with-
bundler-gumby-framework>):

> Since I'm building a new Rails website, and I wanted to use Gumby as a part
> of my Gemfile, and I couldn't find a gem with the newest version of the
> framework, I decided to write my first Rails gem and publish it to the
> community.
