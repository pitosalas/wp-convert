**Link: [Check out CityPockets](None):** ""

I've been using various Groupon-ish web sites to **great advantage.** Whether
it's [Groupon](<http://www.groupon.com>) itself, or
[LivingSocial](<http://livingsocial.com>),
[OpenTable](<http://www.opentable.com>) and others, I send all their offers to
an email folder and scan the 10-15 offers I get a day in one glance (2
seconds) to see if anything jumps out. I end up buying a coupon from one of
them about once a month.

Along comes [CityPockets](<http://www.citypockets.com/>). The site **solves
the problem** of how to remember what coupons you have and especially reminds
you to use them if you lose track of what you have. It actually can log into
each of your groupon-ish accounts and grab whatever new coupons appears there
and displays them in one unified list.

Free, useful and saves money too. I **recommend**
[CityPockets](<http://www.citypockets.com/>)!
