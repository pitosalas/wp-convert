Thomas Friedman with another thought provoking column. I know not everyone
likes his perspective but I find myself in violent agreement more often than
not:

> "All I could think to myself was: If we’re so smart, why are other people
> living so much better than us? What has become of our infrastructure, which
> is so crucial to productivity? Back home, I was greeted by the news that
> General Motors was being bailed out — that’s the G.M. that Fortune magazine
> just noted “lost more than $72 billion in the past four years, and yet you
> can count on one hand the number of executives who have been reassigned or
> lost their job.” (from [New York Times, Time To Reboot
> America](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/opinion/24friedman.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper>)?)
