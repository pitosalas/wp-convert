**Link: [Interesting blog survey](None):** ""

[Blogads has conducted a
survey](<http://www.blogads.com/survey/2005_blog_reader_survey.html>) of
people who read blogs. The results are quite interesting.

>>

>> One thing that stood out to me was that **72% don 't use RSS **(i.e. an
aggregator) to read blogs. This is consistent with another finding, which is
that people who read blogs typically read about 10 of them every day. When
reading "only" 10, using a web browser is more than fine.

>> Check it out, there are lots of other interesting tidbits!
