[Blogads has conducted a
survey](<http://www.blogads.com/survey/2005_blog_reader_survey.html>) of
people who read blogs. The results are quite interesting. One thing that stood
out to me was that**72% don 't use RSS **(i.e. an aggregator) to read blogs.
This is consistent with another finding, which is that people who read blogs
typically read about 10 of them every day. When reading "only" 10, using a web
browser is more than fine. Check it out, there are lots of other interesting
tidbits!
