Actually this is a **great article about strategy** in the [tag]software
business.[/tag] But us Lotus alums remember Symphony and had quite a chuckle
to see that IBM brought back the [tag]Lotus Symphony[/tag] brand.I am waiting
for the second coming of other great product names owned by Lotus: Lotus
