I know basic Javascript. I think I will be learning more soon. I think
JavaScript is the language of the (near) future. Predicting what the language
of the (further) future is would be impossible, as programming languages come
and go. Hopefully they get better as they evolve.

Why do I say that it is the language of the (near) future? Compared, for
example to Java, or Ruby or Python, or even Erlang? Here's an article I wrote
about that: [how JavaScript may be the most important language for the web for
the near future](</imported-20111103233638/2011/6/25/geeky-javascript-
universal-language-of-the-future.html>). Do you agree?

With that context, I was very interested to see Jon Ressig's article about how
Khan Academy is thinking about teaching programming languages. You know I am a
big fan of Khan Academy: see [Khan Academy to the
Rescue.](</imported-20111103233638/2011/10/25/khan-academy-to-the-
rescue.html>)

Here's what Jon has to say about [JavaScript as a first
language:](<http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-as-a-first-language/>)

> "At [Khan Academy](<http://www.khanacademy.org/>) we've been investigating
> teaching Computer Science to students in some new and interesting ways. The
> most interesting aspect of which is that we're likely going to be teaching
> them JavaScript as their first language." ( **from:**[JavaScript as a first
> Language](<http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-as-a-first-language/>))

Read the whole article, it's pretty cool!
