I know all this Sony rootkit/DRM stuff has made me paranoid. I **loaded** my
Sarah McLachlan CD into my Mac (**a single CD**), and **two different CDs
appear on my desktop** (see the screenshot on the left.) One apparently is the
_music_ aspect of the CD and the other is the _computer_ aspect of the CD.
Look inside the former, and you see a bunch of AIFF files. Look inside the
latter and you see a folder structure, including two executables!  Probably
totally innocuous, right? Wait the CD is from Arista records. Any connection
to Sony? Is it loading a rootkit?I dunno. Paranoid. Technorati Tags:
