>> I know all this Sony rootkit/DRM stuff has made me paranoid. I **loaded**
my Sarah McLachlan CD into my Mac ( **a single CD** ), and **two different CDs
appear on my desktop** (see the screenshot on the left.)

>>

>> One apparently is the _music_ aspect of the CD and the other is the
_computer_ aspect of the CD. Look inside the former, and you see a bunch of
AIFF files. Look inside the latter and you see a folder structure, including
two executables!

>>

>> Probably totally innocuous, right? Wait the CD is from Arista records. Any
connection to Sony? Is it loading a rootkit?I dunno. Paranoid.
