So I finally got to try [Hulu Plus](<http://www.hulu.com/plus>) on a one month
promotion, and used it to watch an episode of [Friday Night
Lights](<http://www.nbc.com/friday-night-lights/>). I had read a [recent TV
review comparing Friday Night Lights to Glee, and it made me
curious.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/magazine/how-football-players-
got-trounced-by-glee.html?pagewanted=all>)

Verdict: [Friday Night Lights](<http://www.nbc.com/friday-night-lights/>) -
Excellent!

Verdict: [Hulu Plus](<http://www.hulu.com/plus>) - Commercial after every 7-8
minutes, highly annoying
