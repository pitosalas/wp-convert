If you are in the tech community you've likely heard that Aaron Swartz
committed suicide yesterday in New York. I didn't know him but I was in the
same room with him, at conferences or conversations a few times about 10 years
ago. I certainly knew of him.

I've read many things about him in the last 24 hours. Here are some of the
ones that spoke to me the most:
