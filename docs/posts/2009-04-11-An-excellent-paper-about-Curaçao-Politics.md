This is probably not high on your radar, but if you have interest in the
island of Curaçao you may have heard about the big referendum issue that is
being hotly debated these days.

I won't even try to capture the sides of the argument, rather I want to refer
you to this outstanding paper written by people from Harvard Law School that
cover the issues and sides thoroughly. It is, by the way, extremely well
written.

[The paper is called "A Look Through the Constitutional Prism" and it was
written by Jeremias Prassl and Ben
Gardner.](<http://www.ekvandoorne.com/newsimages/9037_Onderzoeksverslag_lr.pdf>)

Here's a taste:

> "These issues were counterbalanced by a major advantage we brought to this
> study: being European, currently based in the United States, and without any
> past, present or future connection with the Antillean islands or the Kingdom
> of the Netherlands, we could offer each and every respondent a neutral ear;
> whilst many a probing question may have been challenging an interviewee’s
> perception, we strived to maintain strict neutrality whilst gathering data
> in order not to prejudice our findings." (from [A Look Through the
> Constitutional
> Prism](<http://www.ekvandoorne.com/newsimages/9037_Onderzoeksverslag_lr.pdf>))
