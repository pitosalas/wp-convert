We just released [BlogBridge
6.0](<http://www.blogbridge.com/2007/10/19/blogbridge-60-on-our-shelves-right-
now/> "BlogBridge released"). It's getting [really good
reviews](<http://www.blogbridge.com/2007/10/29/blogbridge-60-review-by-robin-
good-of-master-new-media/> "BlogBridge 6.0 Reviews") so you may want to [check
out what I've claimed is the most powerful blog reader out
there.](<http://www.blogbridge.com/look> "Most powerful blog aggregator")

One of the cool new things is the "What's Hot" feature, which is kind of a
built-in meme tracker, but based on your own interests. For example, below is
my report for today. You can see BlogBridge does a really good job culling the
stuff that I care about most. Pretty cool eh? [

[Check BlogBridge out!](<http://www.blogbridge.com/look> "Built in meme

lots of stuff that your current aggregator may
not.](<http://www.blogbridge.com/2007/09/24/can-your-current-tool-do-this/>)
