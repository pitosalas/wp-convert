I saw an article in the New York Times and other places about the future of
the University, and even the End of the University. I have a bit of a
curiosity about this topic as [Lecturer at Brandeis
University](<http://www.brandeis.edu/jbs/r2010programs/websservices/index.html>).
Here's a [blog post from a Professor of Philsophy at Calvin College analyzing
those articles](<http://forsclavigera.blogspot.com/2009/04/end-of-
university.html>) and giving his own perspective, where he says:

> I'm very sympathetic to trying to move beyond the department-as-fortress
> model which currently dominates higher education, despite all of our talk of
> interdisciplinarity. While we might have a veneer of cross-disciplinary
> collaboration, the department-as-fortress rears its ugly head whenever we
> start talking about curricular reform (say, revising the core curriculum of
> a college)-very quickly principled discussion of what constitutes a good
> education devolves into a matter of protecting faculty "lines" in "our"
> department. ( **from** : [The End of the
> University?)](<http://forsclavigera.blogspot.com/2009/04/end-of-
> university.html>)

Really interesting article, with a good insight at the end, which had not
occurred to me:

> "[存nip因 So one scholar will be considering biological issues, another
> political issues, another aesthetic questions, another ethical and
> philosophical issues and so. Sounds fabulous. But where did these scholars
> receive their training in biology, political science, and philosophy?
> [存nip因"
