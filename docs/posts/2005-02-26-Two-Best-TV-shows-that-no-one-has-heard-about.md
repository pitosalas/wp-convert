There are two TV shows that it seems no one knows about, and yet, I think, are
the very best on TV today. Better than West Wing. Better than CSI:xyz. Without
further editorializing:

>>

>> [**MI-5**](<http://www.aetv.com/mi5/>) - A british show about spies.
**Brilliant**.

>>

>> [**24**](<http://www.fox.com/24/>) - A US show that covers a single 24 hour
period over the whole season. Each of 24 episodes covers 1 hour in 1 hour.
**Outstanding.**
