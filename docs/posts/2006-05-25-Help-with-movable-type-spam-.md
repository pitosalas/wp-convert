Both this blog and the BlogBridge have been getting spammed more and with both
comment and trackback spam. It's becoming a real pain. I've poked around my
Movable Type settings looking for solutions but I am sure someone who knows MT
well could tune my configuration with ease. Anyone out there want to lend a
hand? Please email me! Technorati Tags:
