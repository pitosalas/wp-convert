# [Paul Graham: Fear and Startup Ideas](None)




Paul Graham's new essay is "[Frighteningly Ambitious Startup
Ideas."](<http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html>) From my reading of it, it
talks about great startup ideas, fear and cynicism. The meat of the article is
a series of shall we say audacious startup ideas, most of which you've had
yourself and in each case you may have thought: "You'd have to be crazy to try
this!".

I once read, " _If you 're not a little bit nervous, you're not pushing
yourself enough". _I like that mantra. It works for me. This essay is related
to that thought:

> "One of the more surprising things I've noticed while working on Y
> Combinator is how frightening the most ambitious startup ideas are." (from
> [Frighteningly Ambitious Startup
> Ideas.](<http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html>))

And if you are a **certain kind of person** that also may translate to always
being able to find the 100 reasons why something will not work.

I've often said that if I think of my proud career accomplishments so far, in
each case I tried something because I didn't have any idea what I was getting
myself info. **Ignorance is bliss.**

Paul Graham goes a step further:

> "In this essay I'm going to demonstrate this phenomenon by describing some.
> Any one of them could make you a billionaire. That might sound like an
> attractive prospect, and yet when I describe these ideas you may notice you
> find yourself shrinking away from them.
>
> Don't worry, it's not a sign of weakness. Arguably it's a sign of sanity.
> The biggest startup ideas are terrifying. And not just because they'd be a
> lot of work. The biggest ideas seem to threaten your identity: you wonder if
> you'd have enough ambition to carry them through." (from [Frighteningly
> Ambitious Startup Ideas.](<http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html>))

Read the article. It will inspire you!
