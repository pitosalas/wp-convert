There's a lot of buzz right now about the leaked documents related to the war
in Afghanistan. I am not clear myself [whether they teach us anything new
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/opinion/27exum.html?_r=1&ref=wikileaks>)-
they may or may not. Also I have not seen any reports claiming that they were
fake or not authentic.

However in view of the very recent flap about our credulity of anything we see
online (see [Sherrod,
Shirley](<http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011099-503544.html>)) I am
interested that I have not yet seen any deep exposé or reporting about the
reliability of Wikileaks, whatever or whoever that is. This thought came to be
because, by coincidence, a few weeks ago I was following a pretty interesting
thread/flame making all kinds of suspicious allegations about the invisible
face/leader of Wikileaks ([Julian
Assange](<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/07/27/2010-07-27_a_wikid_past_hounds_hacker.html>)),
for example:

> "… What we have here is a high profile ex-hacker trawling for $600K
> operating expenses. Anyone with a few bucks can buy into Assange's snake
> oil, including fronts for any government agency anywhere. From that moment
> on audited accounts don't seem to be available…." ( **from**
> [Cryptome.org](<http://cryptome.org/0001/wikileaks-dream.htm>))

Also see [this link](<http://cryptome.org/0001/wikileaks-mess.htm>) for a
whole bunch of other references.

Now I don't know who [Cryptome](<http://cryptome.org/>) is or who posts there.
That can all be **fabricated** too. So don't listen to me.

I am just raising the question, why is everyone so quick to assume that the
documents on Wikileaks are real? It seems totally possible that there's a
**mix of real and forged** documents.

Let's see some in depth hard reporting on that organization.
