# [David Brooks: The Mother of All No-Brainers](None)




Another on the mark article by [David Brooks: the mother of all no
brainers](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/opinion/05brooks.html?_r=1&src=ISMR_HP_LI_LST_FB>).

I can't help it but I am riveted by this debt ceiling debacle. Like many I
want them to stop bickering and reach and agreement. I know there will be
parts of it that I hate, but I know that overall I will be thrilled that this
particular soap opera/drama/crisis is over, and that our leaders have stopped
acting like children:

> The struggles of the next few weeks are about what sort of party the G.O.P.
> is — a normal conservative party or an odd protest movement that has
> separated itself from normal governance, the normal rules of evidence and
> the ancient habits of our nation.
>
> If the debt ceiling talks fail, independent voters will see that Democrats
> were willing to compromise but Republicans were not. If responsible
> Republicans don’t take control, independents will conclude that Republican
> fanaticism caused this default. They will conclude that Republicans are not
> fit to govern.
>
> And they will be right.
