[ Unlock the Potential of VS Code for Ruby Programming](<
https://betterprogramming.pub/unlock-the-potential-of-vs-code-for-ruby-
programming-c8d853fc77ab>) –Lots of up to date information on how to tune VS
Code for the best Ruby experience. A guide to a free Ruby development
environment. Author says: "If you’re like me and your RubyMine trial version
expired, you’re probably relying on VS Code. While the former is an amazing
tool, it comes behind a paywall, unfortunately. Hopefully, JetBrains will
reconsider at some point and have a Community Edition, just like IntelliJ."
