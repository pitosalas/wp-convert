(**Web site except:** Lots of up to date information on how to tune VS Code for the best Ruby experience. A guide to a free Ruby development environment. Author says: "If you’re like me and your RubyMine trial version expired, you’re probably relying on VS Code. While the former is an amazing tool, it comes behind a paywall, unfortunately. Hopefully, JetBrains will reconsider at some point and have a Community Edition, just like IntelliJ.")
