](<http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/models.php>)This **little
gem** really works! A **StarTrek cool** little device that sits on top of your
stereo or TV set. It's called a [Roku Soundbridge
M1000](<http://www.rokulabs.com/products/soundbridge/models.php>). Has a
remote control, built-in Wi-fi ([which DOESN"T MEAN wireless fidelity, darn
it)](<http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/08/wifi_isnt_short_for_.html>) and
various audio-outs to connect to your amplifier. Simple as pie.

>> **What does it do?** All my iTunes music, playlists, radio stations, smart
play lists, and so on, **now, directly accessible,** searchable and browsable
on that cool **retro** looking illuminated display. And play them through your
big speakers. **Very cool. Very recommended.
