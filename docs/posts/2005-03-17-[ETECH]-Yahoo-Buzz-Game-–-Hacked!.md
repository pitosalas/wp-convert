**Link: [[ETECH] Yahoo Buzz Game – Hacked!](None):** ""

There was some buzz here at ETECH about Yahoo Research's announcement of the
[Buzz Game](<http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/index.html>). It's one of those
online, simulated markets, ostensibly to extract "the wisdom of crowds" about
Technology trends. It looks like a relatively complete immitation of a real
trading site - **a very nice job, and realistic**.

>> The **cool/amusing** development is that **hours** after it was announced a
player called "gogogo" posted did some really clever cheating. Given that this
is a game, I can't be mad, I think it's a an impressive and **interesting
demonstration** of how 'easy' it is to hack one of these things, if you are
clever and dedicated enough. He [revealed all of his secrets

the associated BuzzGame Forum:

>>> "Not satisfied with the results of registering by hand I started to work
on a script to do it for me. First I found a page with open proxies, I then
parsed some 900 entries into a database.

>>>

>>> I built a pseudo web browser that could imitate any browser with any
operating system. Using the nations listed under the proxy list I constructed
a timetable of usual times someone from that country would be using the
internet. With a little scripting and about two hours of investigation I was
able to build an automated buzz cheater."
