From the New York Times, [How Exercise Benefits the
Brain:](<http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/how-exercise-benefits-the-
brain/>)

> "For some time, scientists have believed that BDNF helps explain why mental
> functioning appears to improve with exercise. However, they havenât fully
> understood which parts of the brain are affected or how those effects
> influence thinking. The Irish study suggests that the increases in BDNF
> prompted by exercise may play a particular role in improving memory and
> recall." ( **from** [NYT](<http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/how-
