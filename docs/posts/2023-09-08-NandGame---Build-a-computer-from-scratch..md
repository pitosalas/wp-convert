**Link: [NandGame - Build a computer from scratch.](https://nandgame.com):** "An educational puzzle game. Solve a series of tasks where you build increasingly powerful components. Starts with the simplest logical components and ends up with a programmable computer."

Another really cool geek game where you build a whole CPU from individual nands etc. Crazy tedious.
