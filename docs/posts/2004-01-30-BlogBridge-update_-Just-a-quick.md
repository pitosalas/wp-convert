**BlogBridge update:** Just a quick note about what's up with
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>). My time has been severely drained
by a new consulting project, so progress has slowed down more than I would
like. The last while I was knee-deep in installation, deployment, upgrade
facilities. I looked at a bunch of possible ways of distributing, installing
and then upgrading the application, evaluating 3 of them in detail. What a
mess!

>> In the end I settled on Java Web Start. I used to think of this as a bit of
a kludge, but it seems to be well suited to deployment and installation of
Java apps, and with each release Sun seems to make it a little nicer. So
that's what I am going with.

>> I've learned far more than I ever wanted to know about the CLASSPATH, Jars,
JNLP, and yada-yada-yada. Interesting though, but definitely heavy duty
geekosity.

>> BlogBridge is still in what I would generously call a pre-alpha state. Not
really usable. ([FeedDemon](<http://www.feeddemon.com>) is much better.) If a
few people would like to try out the Java Web Start deployment, send me an
email and we can talk.
