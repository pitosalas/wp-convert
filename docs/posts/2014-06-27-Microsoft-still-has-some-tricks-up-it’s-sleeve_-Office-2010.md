Now I've been a mac for about 4 years now, so I generally don't pay too much
attention to Microsoft's new product releases. But take a look at some of
these videos about Office 2010. There's are some impressive new developments.

I am particularly impressed with the 'backstage view' which appears to pull
together all the functionality that relates to how to get information into and
out of any of the office apps.

[One this site, Office 2010 revealed, you will see many cool
videos.](<http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090713/office-2010-revealed-in-
detail-via-microsoft-videos/>) NB, they seem to have been snatched from a
momentarily present web site, so Microsoft may force them to be taken down.
