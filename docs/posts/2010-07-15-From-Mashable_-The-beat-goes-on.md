A bunch of intersting products still trying to crack the
collaboration/groupware/sharing nut. It's hard.By the way, my current favorite
tool marginally in this category is
[PivotalTracker](<http://www.pivotaltracker.com>), which was not mentioned.
It's an agile/scrum tool, very lightweight, and free for basic use. If you are
[working in an agile team it's really worth a
look](<http://www.pivotaltracker.com>)!
