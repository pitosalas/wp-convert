I came across a good story about
[ModestNeeds.org](<http://www.modestneeds.org/>) from [Deborah Finn's
blog](<http://blog.deborah.elizabeth.finn.com/blog/_archives/2005/6/12/931346.html>),
where she says:

>>

>>> "In other words, although philanthropy no longer looks like it did in the
time when most people lived in small towns and interacted on a face-to-face
basis, it is an activity and a spirit that is alive and well. I would love to
see John and Paul deploying their skills as researchers to document the
ModestNeeds phenomenon and its implications." (from Deborah Finn)
