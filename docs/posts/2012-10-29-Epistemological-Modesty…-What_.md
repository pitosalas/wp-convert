I was listening to an interview with David Brooks the other day. The interview
was conducted by, of all people, Alec Baldwin on "Here's the Thing", a show I
discovered on public radio.

Alec Baldwin is a good actor for a certain kind of role, and can be quite
funny, but [we have learned things about him which are not very likable at
all,](<http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20285148,00.html>) right? But
who knew that he was very intelligent and quite a good interviewer?

The David Brooks interview is very interesting and enlightening and I
recommend it. But this post is mostly to point you to a highfalutin term for
something that makes a lot of sense to me:

> "The correct position is the one held by **self-loathing** intellectuals,
> like Isaiah Berlin, Edmund Burke, James Madison, Michael Oakeshott and
> others. These were pointy heads who understood the limits of what pointy
> heads can know. The phrase for this outlook is epistemological modesty,
> which would make a fine vanity license plate.
>
> The idea is that the world is too complex for us to know, and therefore
> policies should be designed that take account of our ignorance." ( **from**
> "[The American
> Scene",](<http://theamericanscene.com/2009/02/20/epistemological-modesty>) a
> blog I stumbled across when googling the phrase "Epistemological Modesty")

Here is the David Brooks quote where I first encountered the phrase:

> " **David Brooks:** Yeah, so I was a lefty and I was assigned a book called
> "The Reflections of the Revolution in France" by Edmund Burke. And here is a
> guy saying you really shouldn't think for yourself. The power of reason is
> weak. What you should do is rely on the just prejudices that have survived
> the test of time. And I just loathed that book, that idea -- because I
> thought 'I want to think for myself. I want to come up with my own ideas.'
>
> But as I got older, and especially I became a police reporter covering
> crime, murders and rapes in the south side of Chicago, I began to see that
> he's right. Our power of reason is weak. And part of the core of my
> conservatism is the phrase 'epistemological modesty;' the world is
> incredibly complicated; we can’t know much about it. We should be very
> suspicious that we can plan." ( **from** [Here's the Thing: David Brooks
> Transcript](<http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2012/oct/08/transcript/>))

Anyway, it's kind of **dangerous** to be linking to blogs I never heard of or
references to books that I might loathe, references to intellectuals like
Isaiah Berlin, and so on: but who has the time to check all this stuff? I
think the underlying concept of Epistemological Modesty is right on. (Now I
got to go to look of the definition of
[epistemological](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology>). See u!)
