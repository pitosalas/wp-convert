The first personal **computer actually made by Microsoft**! That's
**history**. They've made mice, and X-boxes, but never desktops, laptops, or
tablets.

What **impressive** me about this computer is that it's **not a me-too.**
**Unlike Android** , you can't pigeonhole it as just another iPhone knock off.
It's fundamentally different user interface is **stunning and unique**.

Here's the venerable (yeah) Walt Mossberg's review:

In addition to the computer and the new version of Windows, these computers
have a unique keyboard built into soft screen protector. Very cool! Secondly,
the tablets have a built in 'kick-stand' for standing it upright. Cool again!
**Well done Microsoft!**
