# [Plato: “Be Kind, for Everyone You Meet is Fighting a Great Battle.”](None)




That's a great quote. And no, it's not AT ALL autobiographical. It's just
something that I've thought about for a long time and I loved seeing the
nicely put pithy quote. [I googled it and this was the first hit I
got.](<http://40daysofcompassion.com/2010/03/be-kind-for-everyone-you-meet-is-
fighting-a-great-battle/>)
