I've been thinking a lot lately about what kind of preparation college
students need as they graduate to pursue their futures. Thomas Friedman writes
an excellent column in the New York Times where he says:

This is really true. If your life's ambition is to pursue an advanced degree
then often a college degree is great preparation. For many though, their
life's passion is to join or create a startup and have a really big impact on
the world.
