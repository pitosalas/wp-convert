It's hard to get good data on this, and I keep get wildly varying opinions. I
haven't fully formed my own yet, but here's another data point:

> "In contrast, 50 percent of respondents said that their company did not
> block access to [tag]Facebook[/tag], with eight percent specifying that the
> reason was fear of employee backlash." (from
> [Sophos](<http://sophos.com/pressoffice/news/articles/2007/08/block-
> facebook.html>))

What do you think?
