Here's an insightful [New Yorker article about
procrastination](<http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=all>).
There are some useful ideas and techniques in this article. One of my
favorites is the concept of 'self-binding' (not a form of masochism):

> "The idea of the divided self, though discomfiting to some, can be
> liberating in practical terms, because it encourages you to stop thinking
> about procrastination as something you can beat by just trying harder.
> Instead, we should rely on what Joseph Heath and Joel Anderson, in their
> essay in “The Thief of Time,” call “the extended will”—external tools and
> techniques to help the parts of our selves that want to work. A classic
> illustration of the extended will at work is Ulysses’ decision to have his
> men bind him to the mast of his ship.
>
> Ulysses knows that when he hears the Sirens he will be too weak to resist
> steering the ship onto the rocks in pursuit of them, so he has his men bind
> him, thereby forcing him to adhere to his long-term aims. Similarly, Thomas
> Schelling once said that he would be willing to pay extra in advance for a
> hotel room without a television in it.
>
> Today, problem gamblers write contracts with casinos banning them from the
> premises. And people who are trying to lose weight or finish a project will
> sometimes make bets with their friends so that if they don’t deliver on
> their promise it’ll cost them money." ( **from** the [New
