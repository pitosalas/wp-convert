Take a look at that very weird looking Mac menu. I didn't (knowingly) do
anything to get it and yet every time I launch a new application it's menus
are corrupted that way. All of its menus, and with fancy animated graphics.
Anyone know what's going on? I just told someone today that Mac's NEVER have
viruses!
