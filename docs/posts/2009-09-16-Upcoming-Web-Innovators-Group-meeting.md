Just found out that the [WebInno group](<http://www.eventbrite.com/contact-
organizer?eid=389656473>) is back in session after a summer hiatus. This is
one of the best open meetings for techies and entrepreneurs to meet and talk
and see each other's stuff. Here's the official blurb:

> "The Web Innovators Group (WebInno) is comprised of people engaged in
> internet and mobile innovation in the Boston area. We aim to support
> entrepreneurs, visionaries, and creative thinkers in the field by holding
> events which foster community interaction.
>
> Our regular meetings provide a forum for entrepreneurs from self-
> funded/early-stage startups to present new services to their peers, as well
> as an opportunity for everyone in the community to share and exchange ideas.
>
> WebInno was founded and is currently led by David Beisel of Venrock."

I am going! [I suggest you may want to go
