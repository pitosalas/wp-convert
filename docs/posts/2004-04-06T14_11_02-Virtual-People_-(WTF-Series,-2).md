>> One of the reason that society needs people to transact with each other
using real identities, maybe, is that in the end, virtual digital persona
can’t own and transfer ownership. I can’t buy or sell or trade with a virtual
digital persona. Corporations in fact are virtual people in some sense, and
indeed they are legally regulated much like people are.

and transact separately from me, with it’s own ‘social security number’, the
ability to have a checking account, to own property and generate income. But
for that to happen it would seem to me that the law would have to catch up and
regulate digital personas as a third actor along with natural people and
corporate-like entities.
