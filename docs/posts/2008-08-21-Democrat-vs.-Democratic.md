I wonder about this.

Why is it considered a slur to use [Democrat as an
adjective](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_%28phrase%29>)? For
example, "The Democrat plan is to …" vs. "The Democratic plan is to…"

Oddly enough, do my ear or my mind, Democrat does sound harsh and evil, but I
can't put my finger on why.

Just wondering…
