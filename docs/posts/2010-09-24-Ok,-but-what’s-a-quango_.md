# [Ok, but what’s a quango?](None)




A BBC [Headline](<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11405096>) says:

> "Leaked list suggests 180 quangos to be abolished" ( **from** [BBC Web
> Site](<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11405096>))

Inquiring minds want to know, what the heck is a quango? Before you look it
up, can you guess? First I thought it was a derogatory word for some ethnic
group. Then I thought it might be a currency. [Who
know](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quango>)s?
