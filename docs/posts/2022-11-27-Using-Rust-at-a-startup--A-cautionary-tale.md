**Link: [Using Rust at a startup: A cautionary tale](https://scribe.rip/using-rust-at-a-startup-a-cautionary-tale-42ab823d9454):** "The author (not me) says: “Right up front, I should say that Rust is very good at what it’s designed to do, and if your project needs the specific benefits of Rust (a systems language with high performance, super strong typing, no need for garbage collection, etc.) then Rust is a great choice. But I think that Rust is often used in situations where it’s not a great fit, and teams pay the price of Rust’s complexity and overhead without getting much benefit.”"
