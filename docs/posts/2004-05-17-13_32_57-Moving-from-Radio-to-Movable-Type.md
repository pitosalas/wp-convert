>> **My experience** is that is was pretty easy to move the data (no data lock
in) but the problem was the urls. Even if you take steps to make sure that the
root url doesn't change, the individual post and archive urls will probably
change which means that anyone linked to your blog before will stay linked to
your old blog and so you will experience a disruption in your traffic.
