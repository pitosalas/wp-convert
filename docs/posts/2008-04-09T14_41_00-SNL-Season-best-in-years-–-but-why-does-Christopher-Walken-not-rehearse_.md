[Saturday Night Live ](<http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/>)is having the
**best season in years**. Consistently much funnier than last year or the year
before. Last night, Christopher Walken again was extremely funny: the writing
was funny and his delivery was funnier.

But. It is **extremely distractin** g that Mr. Walken doesn't even try to
**pretend** to appear to be addressing his counterpart in the skit. He so
obviously is reading cue cards that no matter how hard I tried to suspend
disbelief, all I could notice was how he was looking in the wrong direction.I
wonder how that happens. Did he **not rehearse**? Is it, for some wacky
reason, on purpose? Can he just not remember his lines?

It all doesn't add up, because the way he delivers his lines is right on the
money: funny, quirky -- **perfect**.
