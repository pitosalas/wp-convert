Dear users, ex-users, and future users of BlogBridge, As we are approaching
our 1.0 release, we are starting to plan what comes next! It is a good time to
take the pulse of people using BlogBridge regularly and tap into your
collective wisdom! Before getting into that, there are a few preliminaries… We
just released our 0.9 Beta, and 0.10 Weekly build. Check out the Weekly at
http://www.blogbridge.com/install/weekly/blogbridge.jnlp. It is quite
wonderful on all platforms 🙂 People say it's extremely fast and responsive. I
regularly run it with 400 Feeds and it's snappy as anything. (I don't read 400
Feeds, it's more to stress test the app.) Also, have you seen these new
features?

>>

>>   * BlogBridge Themes allow you to tune the UI to what you want it to look
like.  
>
>>   * When you Subscribe to a Feed, or create a new Guide, you can get a list
of suggestions  
>
>>   * Discover Feeds can now run as a one shot command, or you can have
BlogBridge constantly look for interesting feeds for you  
>
>>   * A new command on the Tools menu to send us feedback  
>
>>   * When you set up your keywords, they are now also synched to the
BlogBridge Service so you have them wherever you are  
>
>>   * Take a look at the Feed properties. There are several cool new things
there  
>
>>   * There's more but I want to keep this email short!

By the way, the Weekly is almost always the one you should be running because
it will have the latest features and bug fixes. The Beta is there for when we
mess up and release a broken Weekly, because we are more confident in its
stability. Tapping into your collective wisdom: the main point of this email
We are organizing a small meeting in the Boston (USA) area to talk about what
happens next with BlogBridge. It will be a chance to chat about your
experiences with BlogBridge. But more importantly we'd like to talk about what
direction to take the product and the project, in terms of both features and
strategy. You will really be able to influence what comes next, both in terms
of that little feature you always wanted, or a major new direction for the
project. As a practical matter, I realize that many of you are far away from
the Boston area and wouldn't be able to attend. But I am hoping that there are
enough BlogBridge users in the Boston area to put together a good meeting.
Date and location have not been set yet, but I would expect it to be some time
in March, and likely in Waltham Massachusetts. Of course we'd be very glad to
also engage in an email discussion on the BlogBridge developers mailing list:
blogbridge-devl@lists.sourceforge.net. (Those of you on the yahoo groups list
will notice that there's almost no traffic there.) I will publish interesting
nuggets on my blog as well as things develop. Please let me/us know as soon as
possible how interested you are in participating in this meeting. By the way,
the meeting will happen no matter how many or few people decide that they can
make it, but of course we would especially like YOU to come. Best, Pito Salas
and the BlogBridge team
