My friend Amy just recently arrived from an incredible trip through Asia. If
you are curious, check out [Amy's
blog](<http://asquires.blogspot.com/2009_01_01_archive.html>):

I am reminded of this by [Nicholas Kristof's column from today's New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/opinion/31kristof.html?_r=1&ref=opinion>),
with some tips that Amy might have found interesting (not that she needs tips)
if it had come out 5 months ago:

> "1\. Carry a “decoy wallet,” so that if you are robbed by bandits with large
> guns, you have something to hand over. I keep $40 in my decoy wallet, along
> with an old library card and frequent-flier card. (But don’t begrudge the
> wallet: when my travel buddy was pickpocketed in Peru, we tried to jump the
> pickpocket, who turned out to be backed by an entire gang … )" ( **from**
> [Cum Laude in Evading
> Bandits](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/opinion/31kristof.html?_r=1&ref=opinion>))
