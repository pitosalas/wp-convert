While teaching at Brandeis University this summer (see [Cosi JBS Web
Site](<http://iceland.cs.brandeis.edu/webapps/FrontPage?from=navigationbox>))
I've come to think a lot more deeply about the often cliche'd 'REST' approach
to developing Web Services APIs.

As everyone always says, when you try and explain something, you discover the
little gaps in your own understanding, and end up learning at least as much
from your students as they are learning from you, which is cool, but for
another day.

The essence of the subtlety is captured in the introductory paragraphs of
["Put or Post: The Rest of the
Story"](<http://jcalcote.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/put-or-post-the-rest-of-the-
story/>) (an article that was discovered and shared by one of the students ðŸ™‚

> "Web service designers have tried for some time now to correlate CRUD

> So often, developers will try to correlate these two conceptsâ€“CRUD and

> the-story/>) )

**Idempotency** , hello? Viagra anyone?

This is subtle stuff. Suffice it to say that I bet the majority of people who
talk about REST, and even implement it, are not aware of the nuance. It ties
together what HTTP verb to use with the details of what resource is being
touched and for what purpose.

It's an open question to me whether or how this nuance matters in the real
world.

Perhaps cloud caching services (CDNs) or other elements of the cloud make
assumptions about the exact semantics of the HTTP verbs. Or perhaps there are
enough violations of these principles that as a **practical matter** they are
just of **theoretical importance**.

If you are interested, I recommend that article, as well as [several others
that I put in the intro to the lecture in the course which covered
REST](<http://iceland.cs.brandeis.edu/webapps/RestWebServ?from=wikipage>).

(In retrospect, REST deserves a complete lecture of its own rather than being
part of a much broader and general topic of 'Web Services and Cloud
Computing." Next time.)
