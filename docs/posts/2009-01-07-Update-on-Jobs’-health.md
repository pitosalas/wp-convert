In case you didn't see this, [it's kind of interesting if you follow Apple and
our pal Steve
Jobs:](<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=amga5EoJv6DE&refer=home>)

> "“I have been losing weight throughout 2008. The reason has been a mystery
> to me and my doctors,” Jobs, who turns 54 in February, said today in a
> statement. “After further testing, my doctors think they have found the
> cause -- a hormone imbalance that has been ‘robbing’ me of the proteins my
> body needs to be healthy.” ( **from**[Bloomberg
> News](<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=amga5EoJv6DE&refer=home>))

Read the rest of the [article about Steve Jobs
Health](<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=amga5EoJv6DE&refer=home>).
It's basically commentary. The key is the paragraph above.
