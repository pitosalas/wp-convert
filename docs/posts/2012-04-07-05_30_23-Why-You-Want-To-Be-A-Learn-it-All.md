A provocatively titled article ([Why Youth Has an Advantage In
Innovation)](<http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/03/26/why-youth-has-an-advantage-
in-innovation-why-you-want-to-be-a-learn-it-all/>) argues that to innovate you
have to be an **omnivorous** and **promiscuous** consumer of new stuff. Try
this list on for size, does it fit?

>   1. When a new device or operating system comes out do you rush out to get
> it as soon as possible – just because you want to play with the new
> features? Or do you wait for the dust to settle so that you don’t make a
> mistaken purchase. Or because you don’t want to waste your time.
>   2. Do you use LinkedIn for all of your recruiting, or do you mistakenly
> think that LinkedIn is only for job seekers? How many connections do you
> have? Is your profile up to date? (When Yahoo announced Carol Bartz as CEO,
> I did a quick search on LinkedIn. She was not a registered user.)
>   3. When you heard that Zynga’s Farmville had over 80MM monthly users, did
> you immediately launch the game to see what it was all about, or do you make
> comments about how mindless it is to play such a game? Have you ever
> launched a single Facebook game?
>   4. Do you have an Android phone or do you still use a Blackberry because
> your Chief Security Officer says you have to? I know many “innovators” who
> carry an iPhone and an Android, simply because they know these are the
> smartphones that customers use. And they want exposure to both platforms –
> at a tactile level.
>   5. Do you use the internal camera app on your iPhone because it’s easy, or
> have you downloaded Instgram to find out why 27mm other people use that
> instead?
>   6. Do you leverage Twitter to improve your influence and position in your
> industry or is it more comfortable for you to declare, “why would I tweet?,”
> before you even fully understand the product or why people in similar roles
> are leveraging the medium? Do you follow the industry leaders in your field
> on Twitter? Do you follow your competitors and customers? Do you track your
> company’s products and reputation?
>   7. How many apps are on your smart phone? Do you have well over 50, or
> even 100, because you are routinely downloading each and every app from each
> peer and competitor you can to see how others are exploiting the
> environment? Do you know how WhatsApp, Voxer, and Path leveraged the iphone
> contact list for viral distribution?
>   8. Do you know what Github is and why most startups rely on it as the key
> center of their engineering effort?
>   9. Have you ever mounted an AWS server at Amazon? Do you know how AWS
> pricing works?
>   10. Does it make sense to you to use HTML5 as your mobile solution so that
> you don’t have to code for multiple platforms? Does it bother you that none
> of the leading smartphone app vendors take this approach?
>   11. When you are on the road on business, do you let your assistant book
> the same old car service, or do you tell them, “I want to use Uber just to
> see how it works?”
>   12. When Facebook launched the new timeline feature did you immediately
> build one to see what the company was up to, or did you dismiss this as
> something you shouldn’t waste your time on?
>   13. Have you been to [Glassdoor.com](<http://www.glassdoor.com/>) to see
> what employees are saying about your company? Or have you rationalized why
> it’s not important, the way the way the old-school small business owner
> formerly dismissed his/her Yelp review.
>

Other than the obnoxious title the article does make some good points. I do
believe this:

> "f you want to stay “young” and innovative, you have no choice but to
> immerse yourself in the emerging tools of the current and next generation.
> You MUST stay current, as it is illusionary to imagine being innovative
> without being current." ( **From** [Why You Want to Be A Learn-it-
