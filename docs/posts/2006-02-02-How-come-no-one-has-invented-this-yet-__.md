I write a lot of emails and IMs with smileys 🙂 and big smileys 😀 in them. It's
very effective. But there's one that keeps coming up for which for some reason
there's no correct emoticon, at least as far as I know… I need an emoticon to
denote a funny question. Haven't you had that need 🙂 ? I need an emoticon to
denote a funny question. Haven't you had that need ? 🙂  See the problem? Is
