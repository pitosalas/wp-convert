**Link: [a simple git branching model](https://gist.github.com/jbenet/ee6c9ac48068889b0912):** "This is a very simple git workflow. It (and variants) is in use by many people. I settled on it after using it very effectively at Athena. GitHub does something similar; Zach Holman mentioned it in this talk."
