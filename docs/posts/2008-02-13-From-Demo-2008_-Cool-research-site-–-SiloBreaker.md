Take a look at [SiloBreaker](<http://www.silobreaker.com/>) (don't ask me why
it's called that; is it supposed to break down silos?)

Try typing something into the search box, say "Pakistan". You will see that it
identifies it as a country (it would also identify companies, people, and who
knows what else.) Right off that's interesting, right?

Scroll down and in the right margin you see boxes with some rather unique
perspectives: maps, article volumes, concept network, hotspots, trends,
quotes, and lots of semi structured analysis.

It's a hard site to describe but looks like a unique and useful research tool.
