# [Something I’ve been looking for: Finder Window Manager](None)




Check out [this
post](<http://feeds.tuaw.com/~r/weblogsinc/tuaw/~3/113219781/>) from [The
Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)](<http://www.tuaw.com>):

> This simple utility allows you "to save and restore your window placement
> and view options via Window Sets." You can have different Window Sets for
> different purposes (e.g. different projects, etc.). Just arrange the Finder
> windows as you'd like them and take a snapshot by creating a Window Set;
> later you can easily restore these settings through the menubar item
> (right). There are also a bunch of window management options in the
> Utilities submenu, such as stacking and tiling, etc.
