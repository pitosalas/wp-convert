# [Google’s servers](None)




From an article about Google's hardware:

> "Google's big surprise: each server has its own 12-volt battery to supply
> power if there's a problem with the main source of electricity. The company
> also revealed for the first time that since 2005, its data centers have been
> composed of standard shipping containers-each with 1,160 servers and a power
> consumption that can reach 250 kilowatts." (from

> "CNET"))

There are lots of other choice tidbits about the design of the millions (?) of
tiny servers that Google uses to run its data centers. Quite interesting.
