# [Thoughtful advice](None)




No need to paraphrase or editorialize. Just read the whole thing, will ya?
Lots of good advice that I wish I had gotten years ago.

**[How to steal like an artist (and 9 other things nobody told
me)](<http://www.austinkleon.com/2011/03/30/how-to-steal-like-an-artist-
and-9-other-things-nobody-told-me/>)**

Actually there is one nice tidbit that I got from the [Lifehacker article that
led me to the above link:](<http://lifehacker.com/#!5790337/steal-like-an-
artist-and-relax-nothing-is-original>)

> "It's not a new idea—you've very likely heard the phrase "Good artists
> borrow, great artists steal." It's commonly attributed to Pablo Picasso, or
> T.S. Eliot, though it likely originated with neither. Kleon illustrates his
> point in the cartoon above, and has this to say on the subject:
>
> _' Here's what artists understand. It's the a three-word sentence that fills
> me with hope every time I read it:  
> _
>
> _Nothing is original._
>
> _It says it right there in the Bible. Ecclesiastes:_
>
> _" That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be
> done, And there is nothing new under the sun."_
>
> _Every new idea is just a mashup or a remix of previous ideas. '_

Wow, from the **bible**. Who knew.
