[ Why you should build on Kubernetes from day one - Stack Overflow
Blog](<https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/21/why-you-should-build-on-
kubernetes-from-day-one/>)

If you’re building a new app today, it might be worth taking a closer look at
making it cloud-native and using Kubernetes from the jump. The effort to set
up Kubernetes is less than you think. Certainly, it’s less than the effort it
would take to refactor your app later on to support containerization.
