If you are anything like me, you are constantly coming across books and other
goodies that look interesting but not interesting enough to actually get.

In my house, there are several shelves that contain books purchased but not
yet read. It's my queue. I love them . It's like having a personal bookstore
with only books that I love. Or at least, I think I will love.

The Amazon wish list has become basically another way station between Amazon
and my shelves. I save money by storing part of my queue of interesting books
inside Amazon's wish list. After all, when will I actually read them?

Which brings us to today's topic. Clean up that Amazon wishlist. The holidays
are coming and people actually look at that list and send you gifts. So make
sure that what's on the list is actually stuff that you want to unwrap!

a very handy organizer which allows you to bulk move and bulk categorize stuff
on your list in one fell swoop. So I created a new, private list, called
Pito's personal tickler of stuff I may want and moved two-thirds of the junk
that was on my public wishlist to it. Just look for the "move/copy" button and
you will be golden!

(This post again going to prove that no topic is too mundane for a blog post ðŸ˜‰
