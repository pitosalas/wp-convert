**Link: [Marp: Markdown Presentation Ecosystem](https://marp.app/):** "Marp (also known as the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) provides an intuitive experience for creating beautiful slide decks. You only have to focus on writing your story in a Markdown document."

Another tool to turn markdown into html and css. This is FYI. So far I am still looking.
