>> Last night's event was a **lot of fun**. A ton of energy in the room,
people huddling around comparing notes, even doing some demos. The place was
nice and loud (good) and packed (also good!)

>>

>> **Thanks** again to the co-organizers, [Bela
Labovitch](<http://blogs.opml.org/BelaLabovitch>), [Adam
Green](<http://www.darwinianweb.com/>). Also to the folks at [Top Ten
Sources](<http://www.toptensources.com/toptensources/home.aspx>) and RSS Labs
for sharing their wonderful space with us.

>>

>> If you **missed** this one, **don 't fret**. We'll be organizing the next
one soon, somewhere around the beginning of June.
