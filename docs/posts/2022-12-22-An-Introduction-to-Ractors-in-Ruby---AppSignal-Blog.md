[ An Introduction to Ractors in Ruby | AppSignal Blog](< https://blog.appsignal.com/2022/08/24/an-introduction-to-ractors-in-ruby.html>) –I read and heard about Ractors in ruby. This article demystifies them. My evaluation: Ractors are a safer alternative to Threads. I’m sure thats a massive oversimplification and even incorrect in a way. But for me I need a simple hook to hang the concept onto! The author says: “Discover when and why you should use ractors, and build a ractor in Ruby.”
