I have to do a little research. It seems to be a favorite talking point by
politicians on all sides of a debate to criticize or dismiss a piece of
legislation based on the number of pages it has. It's an odd bit of criticism:
how long is too long, how long is too short, doesn't it depend on how many
laws the bills are enacting? doesn't it depend on the number of amendments?
Watch this space. I am going to find some answers. If you know some of the
data, please post a response or send me an email!
