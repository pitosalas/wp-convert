VRM is a concept that's been floating around for a while. Evangelized (and
perhaps coined) by [Doc Searls](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/>), it has
developed a strong following. In their words:

> "VRM, or Vendor Relationship Management, is the reciprocal of CRM or
> [Customer Relationship
> Management](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Relationship_Management>
> "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Relationship_Management"). It
> provides customers with tools for engaging with vendors in ways that work
> for both parties.

> CRM systems for the duration have borne the full burden of relating with
> customers. VRM will provide customers with the means to bear some of that
> weight, and to help make markets work for _both_ vendors and customers — in
> ways that don't require the former to "lock in" the latter" (from [Project
> VRM)](<http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page>)

That definition is still fairly opaque for me.

I find it easier to explain by simple example: Today, Amazon keeps track of
all their customers and near-customers (like wish list users, web site
visitors, etc.) in a huge database. VRM says that instead, the individual
should own information about themselves and make it available to Amazon (and
other vendors) as desired.

The database that Amazon keeps contains personal, commercial, demographic and
interest information. It's their CRM ("Customer Relationship Management
system.) This database is hugely valuable to them as a way to sell stuff but
also as a way to market stuff. VRM's perspective is that information actually
should be under the explicit control of individuals. They should decide who
gets to see it and they should share in the commercial or non commercial value
of this information.

VRM is a compelling concept. [If VRM intrigues you, here's the ProjectVRM
blog,](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/>) you may want to start following
it.

It's not easy to see how it will get built. So since I've gotten interested in
VRM, I've been thinking about existing systems and products which might be
precursors of VRM.

One site I came across is "[iammoving.com](<http://www.iammoving.com/>)". In
their words:

> "When moving home, notify every organisation of your new address  
> details. iammoving.com reduces the hassle by avoiding call centres and  
> the need to visit individual websites." (from
> [Iammoving.com](<http://www.iammoving.com/>))

I think this service has something to do with VRM. It allows me to control my
virtual change of address card, and decide which vendors and other agencies
ought to be notified of this fact. Pretty cool, unfortunately only available
so far in the UK. (Then again, I am not moving so it's a theoretical negative
at least for me 🙂

What do you think?
