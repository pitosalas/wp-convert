**Link: [Squarespace: What’s a comment spam filter to you?](None):** ""

You may have noticed that this Blog is now hosted on
[SquareSpace](<http://www.squarespace.com/>). I've been pretty happy with it
so far. While it is kind of a closed system, there are extensive customization
features that allow me to get pretty much what I want.

And their support is 24×7 and **very responsive.** Although **not necessarily
always helpful**. Note that I am not the first to observe this. [Joannes

But this post is about **comment spam.** One of the key requirements I had was
that the new blog service would have **comment spam filtering.**

What is comment spam filtering? There are spammers out there that write a
script that just runs through all your posts and write comments on them, with
URLs pointing back to their site. It's a pretty standard way of manipulating
search rankings and driving traffic to your site.

While SquareSpace insists, and **seems to believe** that they have comment
spam filtering, it **doesn 't work at all. **I noticed by the way, that I am
not the first to observe this. [Joannes Vermorel's

Yes I could password protect or IP filter my comments. But if I want to allow
people to easily add comments I open the door to comment spam.

As I write this I am manually deleting hundreds of identical comments, each
from the same site, each with the same title and text. **Clearly SquareSpace
's spam filter isn't doing its job eh?**
