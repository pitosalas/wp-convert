> "First, the Nature Conservancy has a strongly science-based policy for
> making land-purchasing decisions. They take into account things like the
> minimum viable ecosystem size in determining which acquisitions will
> actually have lasting impact.

> Trouble is, for many areas, the conditions those decisions are based on may
> change.

> Areas near sea level are an obvious example. But so are the more than 10,000
> acres of native tallgrass prairie that they have protected in Kansas. How
> much will that ecosystem change with the projected changes in precipitation
> in this region?Obviously, the Nature Conservancy is taking into account such
> projections, as best they can. But they have also decided that the risks of
> climate change to the world's ecosystems are too large to simply adapt to:
> hence their interest in helping to push governments to enact policies that
> will help mitigate it." ( **from:** from

> The Nature Conservency is a great organization. This article gives a lot of
> interesting context and background.
