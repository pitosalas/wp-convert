>> "Time and responsibility. What a prime subject for vapid truisms and
gaseous generalities adding up to the world's most boring sermon. To spare us
both, let me tie this discussion to a specific device, specific responsibility
mechanisms, and specific problems and cases.

>>

>> The main problems might be stated, How do we make long term thinking
automatic and common instead of difficult and rare? How do we make the taking
of long term responsibilities inevitable?" ( **from** [Clock of the Long
Now](<http://www.amazon.com/Clock-Long-Now-Responsibility-

>> "There are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the
other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an
