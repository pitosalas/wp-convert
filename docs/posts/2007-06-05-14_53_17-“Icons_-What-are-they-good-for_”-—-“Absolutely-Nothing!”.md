[Jeremy Wagstaff, in his regular "Loose
Wires"](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118064841957620556.html?mod=Loose+Wire>)
column tells some truth about icons in software:

> "One day, probably quite soon, people are going to look at the little icon

You should read the whole article, it's interesting. One thing he doesn't
mention is that icons don't (directly) depend on the language of the viewer.
Indirectly it does, because there are cultural dependencies on knowing for
example that a stop sign means stop. But still they are more language
independent, in general, than words.

This has two interesting consequences: If I want my software to be accessible
to non-English speakers, I can either have it translated (expensive) or
include icons as a supplemental way to explain functionality and save the
effort and expense of actually translating it. So that's helpful.

As I discovered when I was traveling in Europe though, there are major limits.
I found that standard kitchen gear like stoves and dishwashers often had lots
of buttons and dials that were only identified by mysterious little symbols. I
mean what's the symbol for "rinse only" or "broil"? It was totally
incomprehensible.

I assumed that this occurred in Europe to allow the same piece of equipment to
be marketed in a variety of countries. I guess in Europe, culturally, people
understand the symbols for "broil" and "rinse only." It was greek to me!
