"Lift Off! Get me off this Planet has a casual space theme and never takes
itself too seriously. My goal was to make an easy to learn, fast-paced game,
where everyone feels engaged and "in it" until someone has won or the planet
explodes!

The objective of Lift Off! is to be the first player to get their Aliens off
the planet using resource cards, action cards‚ and phases of the moon to
escape. If the planet explodes before everyone escapes‚ the player with the
most saved Aliens wins."

Fun! I am supporting the [Kickstarter
campaign.](<https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655781518/lift-off-get-me-
off-this-planet>) Are you? You should!
