Michael Feldman of [Dowbrigade](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dowbrigade/>)
has a [really
interesting](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dowbrigade/2005/05/20#a5155>)
report on something that I didn't even know was going on in Boston. Apparently
they/we are thinking about providing wi-fi access across the city:

>>

>>> "However, there are a number of important issues to be resolved before one
of these plans becomes operational: opposition from current ISP's and wireless
phone providers, differing business models for paying for and possibly
charging for the service, which of several competing technologies to support,
and the proper role of municipal and state government in regulating access and
content."

>>

>> Michael has some fun with the 3Ã—5 cards that are apparently the only way to
ask questions from the panel - in the expectation of getting answers by email!

>>

>>> "On our yellow card we carefully wrote "We feel like we are watching
C-SPAN. Why are you afraid to face the opinions of the PEOPLE?" and handed it
to an efficient-looking aide and left to look up another cup of coffee. If the
second panel was anything like the first, we were going to need it."

>>

>> Anyway, check out the [whole
thing](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dowbrigade/2005/05/20%23a5155>). It's a
good read! Technorati Tags: [boston](<http://technorati.com/tag/boston>),
