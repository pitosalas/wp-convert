# [Clever iPhone app vs. the Transistor](None)




This interesting, and I think, correct [article, makes the argument that the
word 'innovation' is being watered down
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-
labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&ref=opinion>)and even getting
**cheapened**. It says, about "innovation",

> "Regrettably, we now use the term to describe almost anything. It can
> describe a smartphone app or a social media tool; or it can describe the
> transistor or the blueprint for a cellphone system. The **differences are
> immense**." ( **from** [Innovation and the Bell Labs
> Miracle)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-
> the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&ref=opinion>)

and leads to this:

> "The conflation of these different kinds of innovations seems to be leading
> us toward a belief that small groups of profit-seeking entrepreneurs turning
> out innovative consumer products are as effective as our innovative
> forebears.
>
> History does not support this belief. The teams at Bell Labs that invented
> the laser, transistor and solar cell were not seeking profits. They were
> seeking understanding. Yet in the process they created not only new products
> but entirely new -- and lucrative -- **industries**." ( **from** [Innovation
> and the Bell Labs
> Miracle)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-
> the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&ref=opinion>)

Excellent points and a **useful distinction**.
