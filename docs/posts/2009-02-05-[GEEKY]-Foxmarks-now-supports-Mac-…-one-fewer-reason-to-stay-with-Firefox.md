I read in [Personal Technology (Wall Street Journal) today that Foxmarks, the
handy, free utility that synchronizes my Firefox bookmarks between several
computers, now works with Safari as
well](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123379804164650385.html?mod=hps_us_my_columnists>).
Great. I tested it, and it does work just fine.

This blog post is being written with another handy firefox plugin called
[Scribefire](<http://www.scribefire.com/>), which lets me post to my blog
directly from a page in the browser. It works really nicely and I use it
frequently. I recommend it. Unfortunately they don't support Safari yet. So I
am staying with Firefox, for now.

By the way, why am I even considering deserting Firefox? Overall it works very
well and the [new 3.1 Beta 2 seems very fast.](<http://www.mozilla.com/en-
US/firefox/all-beta.html>) There are two areas of discontent:

  1. On Mac, the Print dialog box is non-standard, and who cares about that, except that the standard Print dialog on Leopard displays a very useful preview of the pages being printed, something that I frequently miss in Firefox.
  2. For unknown mysterious reasons (I suspect Flash but I don't know) Firefox will go into a frenzy and eat up all my mac's compute cycles. It's annoying when I see my computer get slow, I have to check activity monitor and find Firefox the culprit. I am forced to exit Firefox to get my speed back.
