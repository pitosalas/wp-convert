[ An Introduction to Ractors in Ruby | AppSignal Blog](<
https://blog.appsignal.com/2022/08/24/an-introduction-to-ractors-in-
ruby.html>) –I read and heard about Ractors in ruby. This article demystifies
them. My evaluation: Ractors are a safer alternative to Threads. I’m sure
thats a massive oversimplification and even incorrect in a way. But for me I
need a simple hook to hang the concept onto! The author says: “Discover when
and why you should use ractors, and build a ractor in Ruby.”
