Jim Manzi (of Lotus fame) has an interesting article in "The Nation" about
[our need, as a nation, to invest just a little bit more in
innovation](<http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081117/henry_manzi>):

> "But with only a little bit of extra funding, foresight and determination,
> it may be possible to kick-start an innovation revival. Especially at the
> federal level, we see an opportunity for a modest investment to create a
> whole new generation of idea-growing, job-creating technology hubs all
> across the country-perhaps even an "automotive Silicon Valley" in otherwise
> moribund Detroit." (from [Invest in
> Innovation](<http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081117/henry_manzi>))

A good article, with several memorable phrases, starting with "automotive
Silicon Valley" ('…In such a hub, just as in Boston and Austin, a virtuous
cycle of innovation and product development might be generated.'). Also
"hegemon tax" ('…the 50 to 60 percent share of R&D the US spends on warfare
innovations…')

[Good article, worth reading.
