I got many comments from people about my [postings
](</weblogs/archives/000524.html>)[recently
about](</weblogs/archives/000522.html>) **Lotus Improv**. Imagine my surprise
when I discovered a [pretty accurate description of Improv and its history in
the WikiPedia](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Improv>). By the way, I had
_absolutely nothing_ to do with writing it.  Actually I am quite curious who
did write it, because he or she was pretty well informed so I suspect it's
someone who was on the team from the early days, or knew someone who was. (Of
course there are a few inaccuracies, but what the heck!) **Cool**
