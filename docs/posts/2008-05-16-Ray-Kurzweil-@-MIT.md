Went to hear Ray Kurzweil yesterday at MIT, at an [event jointly sponsored by
IEEE and GBC/ACM Robotics
Sigs](<http://www.ieeeboston.org/robotics_and_automation.htm>). The blurb
said:

> "[â€¦] With input from people around the world, an international group of
> leading technological thinkers were asked to identify the Grand Challenges
> for Engineering in the 21st Century [  
>
> http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/](<http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/>).
> We've invited one of the leading authors of the report, Ray Kurzweil, to
> present some of its findings, give his impressions of the important
> technological trends and challenges likely to occur over the next hundred
> years or so, and challenge you, some of the leading students, researchers,
> and industry practitioners from the Boston and New England area, to help
> solve them." (from [Event
> Invitation](<http://www.ieeeboston.org/robotics_and_automation.htm>))

Who knew there actually was a [National Academy of
Engineering](<http://www.nae.edu/nae/naehome.nsf/weblinks/NAEW-4NHMQM?OpenDocument>),
or even [The National Academies](<http://www.nationalacademies.org/>)? Your
tax dollars at work. Actually the sites are quite informative, and the [Grand
Engineering Challenges](<http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/>) web site and
concept makes for some interesting reading. So worth a look.

Unfortunately Mr. Kurzweil spent the majority of his 2 hours on his [standard
stump speech about the exponential rate of improvement of information based
technology leading to the singularity](<http://www.kurzweilai.net>) (in Q1 of
2029, to be exact), which I have heard before, once or twice. He is a freaking
brilliant guy with a deadpan, monotonic delivery which at first is deadening,
but after a while is amusing and even compelling to listen to.
