I've been **de-friending** one person after another on Twitter. Why? Because
many of them are A-listers who 'generously 'accepted my friendship and are now
**spamming** me via Twitter with their latest exploits. Dull.

As I said in a previous post, [this "Friends 2.0" phenomenon isn't doing it
for me](</2007/05/07/fad-20-is-twitter-just-another-pr-channel/>). My advice
for Twitter users: only 'friend' people who you really know and at some weird
level care whether they are having a ham sandwich.
