What I don't get is the price. First I had to have bought the music (from
Apple or someone else) and now I have to pay again ($24.95 per year) in order
to make it all available over iCloud. I think I will stick with my new
favorite, Spotify.

I am sure I don't fully understand the details, but it seems to me that the
essential benefit that the new iTunes provide is that I can access my whole
music collection (as far as it is 'legal') from any device attached to iCloud.
Anything else?

Well, I think the very idea of 'owning' a music collection is antiquated. I
mean it's evidently inefficient that millions of people have a copy of the
same bits that form "Let It Be" on each of their computers.

iCloud solves this, in one way. I have to buy the 'Let it Be' bits, persuade
iCloud of that fact, and iCloud will let me access their copy of the same
bits, from any device that I connect to iCloud. Ok.

Spotify (and other services like Rhapsody) solve this differently. They buy
the bits and let me rent them for a tiny amount of money, $9.95 per month.
Depending on how much new music I listen to this is more or less expensive
than the combination of buying the song and paying iCloud to host it.

But the advantage is that the music I don't listen to anymore doesn't keep
taking up room on my computer. And new music that becomes available is
immediately available to be under the same subscription fee.

Here's an article on ZDNet Asia, "[iTunes Match: A solution for a problem that
Apple helped create"](<http://www.zdnetasia.com/itunes-match-a-solution-for-a-
problem-apple-helped-create-62302882.htm>) , that is I agree with.

There are a few more reviews in on the Kindle Fire that are more positive.
