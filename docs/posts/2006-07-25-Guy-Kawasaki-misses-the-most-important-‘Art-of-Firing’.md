is one of my heroes and [his blog is one of my
favorites](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/>). A [post
today](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/the_art_of_firi.html>) on the 'Art
of Firing' is a good summary:

>>

>>> "I've fired people a few times in my career, and I hated everything about
the process. I'm not sure I did it well when I did it, but I've thought a lot
about how it should be done. Here is my best shot at "The Art of Firing
People." (**from** "[The Art of
Firing](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/the_art_of_firi.html>)")

>>

>> [Read it,](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/the_art_of_firi.html>) it
has very good advice. But in my opinion, **Guy omits the most important, step
"0**": Before firing someone you need to ensure that you've given them
**adequate, honest, and timely feedback** on whatever issues you perceive
there are and well before there's any thought about firing. It's more than
"Consulting impartial people" and a lot more than "Searching your soul". And
while related, it's not the same as "Give people a second chance." A second
chance means that there are serious, firing-level problems but you hold your
fire.
