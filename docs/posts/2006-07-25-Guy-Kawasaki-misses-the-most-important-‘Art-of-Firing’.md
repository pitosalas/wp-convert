is one of my heroes and [his blog is one of my
favorites](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/>).

>> A [post today](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/the_art_of_firi.html>)
on the 'Art of Firing' is a good summary:

>>

>>> "I've fired people a few times in my career, and I hated everything about
the process. I'm not sure I did it well when I did it, but I've thought a lot
about how it should be done. Here is my best shot at "The Art of Firing
People." ( **from** "[The Art of
Firing](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/the_art_of_firi.html>)")

>>

>> [Read it,](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/07/the_art_of_firi.html>) it
has very good advice. But in my opinion, **Guy omits the most important, step
"0**":

>>

>> Before firing someone you need to ensure that you've given them **adequate,
honest, and timely feedback** on whatever issues you perceive there are and
well before there's any thought about firing.

>>

>> It's more than "Consulting impartial people" and a lot more than "Searching
your soul". And while related, it's not the same as "Give people a second
chance." A second chance means that there are serious, firing-level problems
but you hold your fire.

> This is really "give people a **real first chance**."
>>

>> Many managers just don't give the direct and honest and unvarnished
feedback to someone well before things get to the point where you are
considering firing them.

>>

>> Another one of my heroes is [Gerald
Weinberg](<http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/>), author of my all time favorite
management book, "[Becoming a Technical
Leader"](<http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/books.html>) says: "Everyone is doing
the very best job they know how to, **given the circumstances.** " Very often
if someone is not doing the job, examine the circumstances carefully and
honestly and you may well figure out a way to improve things.
