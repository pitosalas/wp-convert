We all have heard more than once that "VCs will NOT sign NDAs, don't even
ask!". And we've also heard and said many times that "Ideas are cheap" and
that many first time entrepreneurs are far too precious about their great
ideas. They keep them top top secret, ask prospective customers to sign an
NDA, and in general undermine their own ability to get useful real feedback on
the thing they want to create. The attached article is interesting in its
analysis of those tradeoffs:

"Not everyone agrees. Thom Ruhe, vice president for entrepreneurship at the
Kauffman Foundation, said the declining use of N.D.A.s “is certainly not in
the interests of entrepreneurs. It favors the V.C.” Although it is rare that
an investor steals an idea, Mr. Ruhe said, it does happen. “But in the skewed
echo chamber of the Valley, and the sycophantical networks that aspire to be
just like them,” he said, “they’ve made the easier and less morally defensible
position — no N.D.A.s — the coin of the realm.”
