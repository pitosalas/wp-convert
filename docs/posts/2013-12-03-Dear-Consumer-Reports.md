# [Dear Consumer Reports](None)




From an email I sent, just because:

> "Dear CU:

> I bet you won't print this one! But maybe you can respond to me personally.
>
> [Check this out](</imported-20111103233638/2013/8/22/dear-consumer-reports-
> consumerreports.html>)
>
> CU itself is a bad actor when it comes to magazine subscription renewals.
>
> I get misleading requests that my subscription is about to run out when it
> actually has months, as many as six months to go! And if I am not on my toes
> I could easily be fooled into a premature renewal and extension of my
> subscription.
>
> This is a very misleading practice.
>
> You say everyone does it, which is true. You say that it's part of your
> business model and it really works to maximize renewals, which is also true.
>
> But it still very misleading bordering on deceitful and I bet you would call
> out another company for something similar or even less evil - for example, a
> simple typo in an advertisement which is a clearly sloppiness but not
> purposely deceitful.

> What say you?
