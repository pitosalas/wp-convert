>> You may not have heard of this, but we are now starting to see quite decent
word processing applications implemented directly in the browser, using a
technique that has become known as "AJAX" - Asyncrhonous Javascript And XML.
As usual there is debate about what AJAX really means, who invented it
(Microsoft claims that they had it like 5 years ago - which everyone scoffs
at.) [Here's a good article about Ajax and how it's being used to build word
processing
applications](<http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/columns/executive_tech/article.php/3567061>)
that run directly in the browser:

>>> "None of these methods, however, are as simple to set up as a standard Web
browser, which can quickly access a file from anywhere in the world. That's
the promise that AJAX brings to the party." ( **from** [AJAX: the way word
processing will
be](<http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/columns/executive_tech/article.php/3567061>))

>>> One very impressive example cited in the article is
[Writely](<http://www.writely.com/>). It's (of course) free and easy to try.
It really seems to work. Of course when it comes to word processing, features
matter, but reliability matters a lot too. Last thing I want is to lose the 10
page term paper and not be able to retrieve it. [Check it out.
