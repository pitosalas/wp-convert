While I am in the mood to reveal some of my weaknesses ([see post on Dieting
](</imported-20111103233638/2012/1/21/secret-trick-for-losing-weight.html>)two
days ago) let's talk about information overload.

I employ various tools and tricks to make sure I can focus on what is
important to me and shut out distractions. I've written about them before. Two
of my favorites are [so-called self
binding](</imported-20111103233638/2010/10/11/do-you-procrastinate-i-do.html>)
(sounds weird but it's not) and a utility app called
[Concentrate](<http://getconcentrating.com/>).

A book just came out called "[The Information
Diet"](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449304680?ie=UTF8&tag=clayworld-20&linkCode=shr&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=1449304680&ref_=sr_1_1&qid=1319838673&sr=8-1>).
In fact [Clay Johnson's PR
](<http://www.amazon.com/Clay-A.-Johnson/e/B005PHQHJ6/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1>)is
**so good** that I know all about this book except I am not exactly sure if
has actually been published yet. I feel like I've read it. Funny the launch of
the book has the **feeling of a political campaign**. Hmm.

Anyway here's a post from his blog that I thought was worthwhile: [How to
start your information diet](<http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/how-to-
start-your-information-diet>). Many of the tips here I am already following,
but a simple one was a bit of a revelation for me, because it was so obvious
but I hadn't thought about it **this way:**

> "Turn off all desktop notifications on your computer. If you're an Outlook
> user, turn its desktop alerts off. If you're an OS X User, and have somehow
> ended up with Growl installed on your computer, turn off all notifications."
