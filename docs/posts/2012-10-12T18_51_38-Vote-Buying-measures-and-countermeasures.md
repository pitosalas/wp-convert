An interesting question, and an expert answer from a friend of mine. If you
are interested in elections and voting and how they can and cannot be bought,
you might find this intriguing. By the way, this scheme would never work in
the US as we have many mechanisms that would prevent that, but these might
apply in other countries that are not as sophisticated.

Scenario:

> Say a bad guy made an offer secretly to the population that he would give
> each voter $100 for a vote cast for himself. Say they are using optical scan
> ballots. Say that cell phone cameras are easily snuck into the polling
> booth.

Here's the analysis:

> Before the Australian ballot, it was easy! Anybody can print a ballot, lots
> of straight party ballots printed. You go to your party boss in your polling
> place, he gives you a ballot, you put in the box, simple. When the party

> could observe you not getting a different. With some slight of hand you
> could trick them, but still very effective b/c most people won't attempt the
> slight of hand under threat of kneecapping. The almost as soon as Australian
> ballot was adopted (you might get a blank ballot from a government official
> in the polling place and mark it in the polling place), [chain
> voting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_scan_voting_system>) was

>
> Now, today, chain voting is too pesky and low throughput, how about we use
> the voter's digital camera in the polling booth! The can take a picture of
> the ballot that they marked as instructed by the boss. You show the boss a
> picture on your camera, he gives you money and/or spares your kneecaps. But
> wait! The digital photo can be faked? Hmmm.
>
> I think that is the stage you've set. There are two main questions. What

> for real photos to be produced?
>
> A separate question, new to me: if you were the government or an activist,

> There would need to be lots of training both of voters -- we really don't

> still vote a real secret ballot in the polling place. I could even make a
> fake picture in the voting booth, using a pre-made ballot, but then marking
> a real blank ballot and casting that. From there you are in a spy vs spy
