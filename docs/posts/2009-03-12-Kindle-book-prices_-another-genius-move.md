Take a book that I was interested in, ["The Lords of Finance", by Liaquat
Ahamed](<http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Finance-Bankers-Broke-
World/dp/159420182X/ref=sr_oe_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=digital-
text&qid=1236871289&sr=1-1>). This is a brand new book, very timely that I
heard mentioned on TV.

Prices:

  * **Sample Chapter on "Kindle" (including Kindle on iPhone): $0. **I read it and thought it was really good and was tempted to buy it. But I almost never buy hardcovers so normally I would wait for it to come out in paperback.

  * [**Hardcover, List Price: $32.95**](<http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Finance-Bankers-Broke-World/dp/159420182X/ref=sr_oe_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=digital-text&qid=1236871289&sr=1-1>)

  * [**Hardcover, Amazon price: $20.76**](<http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Finance-Bankers-Broke-World/dp/159420182X/ref=sr_oe_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=digital-text&qid=1236871289&sr=1-1>)

  * **[EBook, for Sony Reader: $32.95](<http://www.ebooks.com/ebooks/book_display.asp?IID=411896>). **What??? If I have a Sony eBook Reader I pay FULL PRICE for the electronic edition of the book?

  * Paperback edition: Not Yet Available. May never be.

  * **[EBook for Kindle: $9.99!](<http://www.amazon.com/Lords-of-Finance/dp/B001QIGZEK/ref=ed_oe_k>)**

I think this might again turn the publishing world upside down. Questions:

  1. Will it cause publishers and printers to loose a bunch of money because people who normally buy hardcovers will by Kindle books instead?

  2. Will it cause them to MAKE a bunch of money because people who never buy hardcovers now will buy Kindle books (as I am tempted to, with this particular book)

  3. What is Sony thinking? I think they are running a huge free marketing program for Kindle. They convince someone to read books on a device, and once they do they see the huge amount of money they can save by doing it on a kindle and go buy one.

Genius?!
