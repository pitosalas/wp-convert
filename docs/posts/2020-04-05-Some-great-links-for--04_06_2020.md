  * [The Art of Command Line](<https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/README.md>)

We all live in the shell. (Yes, if you're not geekish that sentence makes no
sense). And you can always learn a little more and some special trick to make
your day. Here's another reference.

  * [Great collection of Public APIs](<https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis>)

Well I always look at ProgrammableWeb.com but it's becoming more and more
cluttered with ads and whatnot. Also there's so much in it, I think it's
totally uncharted.

  * [Collection of free programming books](<https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books>)

I hope these are all public domain. Can't check them all. But I assume so
because it's on Github

  * [Build your own … whatever!](<https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x>)

Build your own… operating system, programming language, web server, etc.
