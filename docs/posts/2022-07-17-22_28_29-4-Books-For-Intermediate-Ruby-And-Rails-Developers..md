(**Web site except:** I’m a fan of good books. Through my Ruby and Rails journey, I’ve discovered a few excellent books that I’d like to share with fellow Rubyists. The authors of these books are experts in their fields. These books are my recommendation and I think they deserve some space on your desk.)
