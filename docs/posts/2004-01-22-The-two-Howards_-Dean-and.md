>> **The two Howards: Dean and Stern.** Everyone is **wringing their hands**
about the way Howard Dean acted out on the night of the Iowa Caucuses. I heard
well known pundits talk about **' the defining moment of Dean's campaign**.'
What a bunch of **nonsense**. This was a non-event, a crazy moment at the end
of a long day with a huge crowd of revved up supporters. And indeed [some of
my friends](<http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/01/21#freeAdviceForDrDean>) [who
support Dean](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002369.html>) have
commented, more eloquently than this, in his defense as well.

>> Forgive me to mention **the other Howard** in the same breath, but the best
came on Howard Stern's show, who by the way, was making fun of the
commentators and siding with Dean. A caller said that it was a classic 'Rocky'
moment and that all you needed was to hear the theme from Rocky playing in the
background and it would just 'bring a tear to your eye.' I can't play it for
you here, but either use your imagination, or take my word for it: it was one
of the **all time funiest moments on Radio**.
