An interesting article in the [New York Times Magazine today about 'Strictly
Platonic Relationships](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25FOB-
Medium-t.html>)', according to Craigs' List denizens:

> 'And while they stress their lofty indifferences, the members of the
> Strictly Platonic crowd are equally passionate about their desire:
> conversation, conversation, conversation. Live, e-mail, phone, text, chat â€”
> platonic people, it seems, want people to talk to.'
