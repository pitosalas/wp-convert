Scoble has a good commentary and links to more commentary about Kiko. Kiko is
a web 2.0 / ajax / cool calendar application that appears to be throwing in
the towel. Here's what Scoble had to say:  Does Kiko predict more Web 2.0

>> rings true to me. I have a constant internal battle (which I've written
about more than once) around the theme of why everyone expects everything to
be free.  And by the way why anything that takes more than 2 months to build
is too long. Maybe for the cool kids, but for a real company with a real
business, it's gonna take you longer than 2 months.
