**Link: [Interesting old article by Marvin Minsky](None):** ""



Just came across this odd link somewhere. He's a good and clear writer,
enjoyable to read whether you agree or not: [Why People Think Computers Can't
by Marvin
Minsky](<http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Eminsky/papers/ComputersCantThink.txt>).
