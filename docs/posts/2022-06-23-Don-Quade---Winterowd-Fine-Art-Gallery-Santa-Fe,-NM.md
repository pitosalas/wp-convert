(**Web site except:** Don Quadeâ€™s mixed media paintings are elegant expressions inspired by nature. The transformation of the textures and colors within a garden from season to season is an exciting source of inspiration for this artist. He enjoys the subtle shifts in nature: the rich textures and warm tones of the fall and winter juxtaposed with the soft and vibrant colors that spring and summer bring.)
