If you are interested in design and especially design and architecture of
software, and you have a philosophical bent, you will enjoy this essayâ€¦ I
can't even attempt to summarize it's content, and even the abstract from the
paper itself is quite inscrutable:

> "Conceptual integrity arises not (simply) from one mind or from a small
> number of agreeing resonant minds, but from sometimes hidden co-authors and
> the thing designed itself." (**From** [Designed As
> Designer](<http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignedAsDesignerExpanded.pdf>))

What can I tell you. The author is the [Richard
Gabriel,](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel>) a luminary of the
computer world. Here's the article: [Designed as
Designer](<http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignedAsDesignerExpanded.pdf>).
