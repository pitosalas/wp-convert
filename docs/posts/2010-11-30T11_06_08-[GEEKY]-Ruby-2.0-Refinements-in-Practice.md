I went to RubyConf and heard a detailed presentation on a new possible feature
of possible Ruby 2.0 called 'Refinements'. I have to admit that I didn't fully
grasp how the feature really would be used. Here's a nice and quite techical
article about it: [Ruby 2.0 Refinements in
Practice](<http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/KatzGotYourTongue/~3/G8_3uN8vjJo/>)
from [Katz Got Your Tongue?](<http://yehudakatz.com/feed/rss/>):

> "The first thing you need to understand is that the purpose of refinements
> in Ruby 2.0 is to make monkey-patching safer. Specifically, the goal is to
> make it possible to extend core classes, but to limit the effect of those
> extensions to a particular area of code."
