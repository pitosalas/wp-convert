# [Ideas are still cheap, right?](None)




From XConomy Seattle, this article covers '[an inspiring talk by Nick Hanauer
of Seattle-based Second Avenue
Partners](<http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2008/12/03/how-to-spot-a-
breakthrough-tips-from-early-amazon-investor-nick-hanauer/>)'. It's a good
read with lots of useful insights.

Here's his formula for judging whether your idea for a new product is any
good. I am not sure whether I like these because they are cleverly worded and
snarky or whether there's a big grain of truth in them. Probably a little of
both.

  * If everyone thinks it’s a great idea, it probably sucks.

  * If people understand it, you’re too late.

  * If people don’t like it _and_ don’t understand it, it probably still sucks.

A little more from the article:

> "So entrepreneurship is a dangerous field, he said. “The **difference
> between being an idiot and being a genius is very, very thin**.” And keep in
> mind, he pointed out, “you can be very successful without being socially
> disruptive. Great fortunes have been made doing incremental things. Burger
> King, which came after McDonald’s, was not transformational, despite what
> they tell you…But they made a great fortune."
