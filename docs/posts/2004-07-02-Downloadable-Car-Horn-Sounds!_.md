Did you know that you (or your teenager) can buy cool new ring tones for their
cell phone? They cost a buck or two and are quite the rage, especially in
countries other than the US 🙂 You probably knew this.

>>

>> Did you know that this buck or two is actually only good for a month or two
of use of the ring tone, after which you would have to buy a renewal or more
likely a new one? You might or might not have known this.

>>

>> How about the fact (at least I heard it as fact in more than one place, but
I cannot corroborate) that downloadable ring tones account for a $3.5 BILLION
business. Hard to believe isn't it?

>>

>> Well here's a cute idea (which is so cute, we can bet it will happen) which
I heard tossed out by someone at JavaOne. With cars being equipped with more
and more electronics, including now GPS and two way communication, how about a
business selling downloadable Horn Sounds for your car?

>>

>> Is the latest single from WhoUKnow all the rage? How about using that rif
for your horn? How about a Star Trek Condition-Red Claxon?

>>

>> It could happen… 🙂
