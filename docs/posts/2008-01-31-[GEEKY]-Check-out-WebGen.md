Sites that have to support a huge amount of traffic tend to want to be static
html. No matter how fast PHP or perl is, in the end, static pages win. So
tools pop up to allow you to generate a templated site, but generate it into
static html to kind of have your cake and eat it too.

[Webgen](<http://webgen.rubyforge.org/index.html>) is one of those static web
site generators. Here's what it does:

> "When webgen is run it combines the template with each of the page files and
> generates the HTML output files. During this process special tags are
> substituted so that, for example, a menu is generated. Actually, this
> website was generated with webgen and, for example, the menu that you can
> see was created dynamically. For more information look at the
> documentation!" (**from** [Webgen](<http://webgen.rubyforge.org/index.html>
