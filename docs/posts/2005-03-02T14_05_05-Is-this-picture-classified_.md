[![5607434_77c4bfa47d_m.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/weblogs/uav/5607434_77c4bfa47d_m.jpg?resize=180%2C131)](<http://www.flickr.com/photos/juan64/5607434/>)I
am quickly becoming a [Flickr](<http://www.flickr.com/>) fan. What took me so
long, you ask? Well for those of you that don't know Flickr, it's a site where
legions of users host their digital snapshots. So far, nothing new, right?

>>

>> But here's where it gets interesting. People are asked to TAG their
pictures and they do. So if you are for example, interested in Iraq, you could
[see all pictures added that are tagged
"IRAQ.](<http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/iraq/>)" And by the way, there's a
[corresponding RSS feed for each
tag](<http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=iraq&format=rss_200>).

>>

>> So just add your Iraq RSS feed to your [favorite
aggregator](<http://www.blogbridge.com>) and get a daily download of cool
pictures.

>>

>> Hence the title of this post. This is a nice picture of what looks to me
like a Predator UAV. [From the Iraq Tag on
Flickr](<http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/iraq/>). Classified? Who knows!
