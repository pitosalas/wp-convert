I am a big fan of Facebook. They are doing so many things well. They have
become so pervasive that if anyone is doing anything that involves a group of
people online the first and biggest question should be, why should we not put
this on Facebook? Because it works on so many levels.

But all is not rosy. I wanted to create a presence on Facebook for a place
called Windward Harbor. Should I be creating a Place, Page, a Group or a List?
I don't have the time or inclination to try to figure that out. Here's one
example where having more than one way to do the same thing is just not that
useful.

If you know better, please illuminate me!
