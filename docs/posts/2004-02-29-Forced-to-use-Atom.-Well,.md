**Forced to use Atom.** Well, it's happening… My friend [Paul
English](<http://www.paulenglish.com/>) has been using Blogger for the longest
time for his personal blog. I often complained to him that I used a Blog
Reader (FeedDemon is my current favorite, until BlogBridge comes out 🙂 and
wouldn't be able to follow his blog until he had a feed…

>> Well as you may know, [Blogger](<http://www.blogger.com/>) now has a feed,
and it's uses the Atom format. In the **' tempest in a teapot'** department,
you might have followed the Atom/RSS battle, which took an interesting turn
when Blogger (=Google) decided to support _only_ Atom as their format. Clever
strategic move or **small minded vindictiveness**?

>> So, Paul's blog is the first time that I have been **forced to use Atom**.
Luckily the latest Beta of **FeedDemon _does_ support Atom** and so I can read
Paul's blog right along all my other favorites.

>> This is just another in the continuing format, API, or protocol conflicts
which arise constantly in the our business. It's a **good kind of conflict**
because it raises important issues and allows things to evolve to a better
place.

>> Remember VIM and MAPI? That battle **shook the very foundations** of the
software industry at the time. (VIM stood for "Vendor Independent Messaging"
but the running joke was that it really stood for "Vendors Ignoring
Microsoft", led by Lotus. Remember Lotus 😉 And more recently, how about
**SHTTP vs. HTTPS**? HTTPS eventually became SSL which of course is all anyone
remembers.

>> My point is that as our products and visions and customers and platforms
move forward, there is a **constant tension between evolution and
compatibility**. It's clear that this is a good thing in the end, although a
whole lot of glass is broken along the way. The one thing I know for sure is
that it's **way too early to stop the evolution right now**.
