I like to come across music from my collection of CDs that I haven't listened
to in a while. Here's what I do:

>>

>>   1. I create a "Smart Playlist" called, for example, Folk - Unplayed

>>   2. The "match query" includes Genere is Folk and Play Count is 0

>>

As I play this list, it gets continually shorter as each song is played and
removed from the list. Riff on this technique - other genres? Played once
only? etc. Neat. Technorati Tags: [cool](<http://technorati.com/tag/cool>),
