Just check out this well argued, detailed piece, "[Wake up to the dangers of a
deepening crisis", by Lawrence
Summers](<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b56079a8-9b71-11dc-8aad-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=95e85a0c-68fd-11db-b4c2-0000779e2340,print=yes.html>):

> "Three months ago it was reasonable to expect that the subprime credit

This gloom and doom view is echoed by much of the commentary I've come across
over the last month, for example, this from today's New York Times,
["Innovating Our Way to Financial Crisis":
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?ref=opinion>)

> "The bottom line is that policy makers left the financial industry free to
> innovate — and what it did was to innovate itself, and the rest of us, into
> a big, nasty mess." (from [Paul Krugman in the New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?ref=opinion>).)

You be the judge. I'm calling my broker 🙂
