**Link: [Is Skype “Full Duplex”?](None):** ""



What an antiquated term: Full Duplex. I don't know if that term is used
anymore but what i mean is this:

I use Skype on many many voice calls, either to other Skype users or to
telephone. It seems to me that while the other person is talking, I cannot
interrupt them. In other words, either I am talking or I am listening, but not
both.

Am I mistaken? Or is my Skype set up incorrectly?

Full Duplex is a term that used to mean, maybe still means, that both parties
to a connection can be active at the same time. Last time I used it, it was in
reference to a teletype machine!
