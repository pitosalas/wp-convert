Here is [a good cheat sheet on how to build products that people really want.
It is cribbed from this article on
TechCrunch.](<http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/30/instagram-co-founder-mike-
kriegers-8-principles-for-building-products-people-want/>)

>   * Draw On Previous Experience and Understanding – The biggest problem is
> startups in search of a problem. Chase what you’re passionate about; you’ll
> probably already have knowledge in the space.
>   * Have A Hypothesis About How You’re Different – Have a point of view
> about your startup. Why is there a special opportunity for this now?
>   * Never Build Without Sketching – Mike says he and Instagram co-founder
> Kevin Systrom would go to a cafe with little iPhone design pads where “we’d
> build and throw away entire features. You’d waste three or four pieces of
> paper, not three weeks of coding.”
>   * Learn In Weeklong Increments – Start with a question: “Will folks want
> to share photos on the go? Can we build filters that look good?” Spend the
> week investigating, and by Friday have a conclusion and move on.
>   * Validate In Social Situations – “We called this the Bar Exam. If you
> can’t explain it to the guy or girl at the bar, you need to simplify.” Don’t
> just test with your techy friends.
>   * Know When It’s Time To Move On – “I know ‘pivot’ has become a dirty
> word, but if there’s no unanswered questions left, then it’s time to move
> on.”
>   * The Wizard Of Oz Techniques For Social Prototyping – You don’t need to
> build everything at first. You can be the man behind the curtain. Krieger
> says him and Systrom tested an early version of a feature which would notify
> you when friends joined the service. Instead of building it out, they
> manually sent people notifications “like a human bot” saying ‘your friend
> has joined.’ It turned out not to be useful. “We wrote zero lines of Python,
> so we had zero lines to throw away.”
>   * Build And Maintain A Constant Stream Of Communication With Your Audience
> – Don’t spend months building something without any idea if someone actually
> wants it.
