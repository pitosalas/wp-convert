Ok a few hours into it, I've located what looks like a major weakness in
Spotify. One of the fun things about Rhapsody is discovering new music. What
are the top albums in "Piano Jazz". Had to look and look for a similar feature
in Spotify. The closest I can find is to type this into the search box:

genre:"piano jazz"

Oy! And by the way, how am I supposed to know that "piano jazz" is a
legitimate genre? Oh [just look on this
list.](<https://www.spotify.com/us/about/features/advanced-search-
syntax/genre-list/>)

Whoops. Piano Jazz is not a real genre, so it doesn't work.

Any one know any tips?
