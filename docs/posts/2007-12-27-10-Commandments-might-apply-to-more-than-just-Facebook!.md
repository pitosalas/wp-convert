Check out these [10 Commandments for Facebook
Applications](<http://facereviews.com/2007/12/27/10-commandments-for-facebook-
applications/>). They are pretty good commandments for software in general. I
especially like:

> "Make it simple. Users DO NOT read.", **from**
> [FaceReviews](<http://www.facereviews.com/>)

Yup, I have seen that time and time again with
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>). Hard to believe. But true. Of
course there's the 1 in a thousand who ask for more documentation, but they
are very rare.

[if you are interested in [Facebook](<http://www.facebook.com>), take a look
at [BlogBridge's Guide of Facebook blogs and
feeds](<http://library.blogbridge.com/folder/13069-world-of-facebook>)]
