I've [subscribed to this list](<http://www.ociweb.com/jnb/index.html>) from
[OCI](<http://www.ociweb.com/>) ("Object Computing Inc.") for a while now.
They always have interesting readable articles on one thing or another related
to Java. If you are interested in Java, I **recommend** it! Technorati Tags:
