I don't want to label myself as a fuddie-duddie. I keep thinking back to this
talk at ETech. [Quinn Norton](<http://www.ambiguous.org/quinn/>) is a engaging
and funny speaker who talked about ["body hacking" (click to see the
slides)](<http://www.ambiguous.org/quinn/bodyhacking.html>)

I learned things like what "Furries" are, that people (including Quinn) have
implanted [rare earth magnets into their finger
tips](<http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mods/news/2006/06/71087>), literally
trying to get a sixth sense, what
[provigil](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil>) is, and lots of other
wonders. As I said, a [memorable
talk](<http://www.ambiguous.org/quinn/bodyhacking.html>).

I learned new things. If that makes me a fuddie-duddie, so be it ðŸ˜‰
