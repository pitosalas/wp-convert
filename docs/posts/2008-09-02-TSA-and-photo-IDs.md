An interesting article from Bruce Schneier about why he believes that TSA
requirement of photo IDs is a waste of time:

> "The problem is that it is unverified passenger names that get checked
> against the no-fly list. At security checkpoints, the TSA just matches IDs
> to whatever is printed on the boarding passes. The airline checks boarding
> passes against tickets when people board the plane. But because no one
> checks ticketed names against IDs, the security breaks down." (from[ Los
> Angeles Times](<http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-
> schneier28-2008aug28,0,3099808.story>))

Particularly interesting is that he has specific instructions in the article
on how "anyone on the no-fly list can easily fly whenever he wants". I
remember a [couple of years ago some guy got into heap trouble with the FBI
for posting a little web hack](</2006/10/27/tsa-has-no-clothes/>) for doing
just what Schneier gives instructions for. I wonder whether Schneier will get
a call from them? Nah, he's too well known!
