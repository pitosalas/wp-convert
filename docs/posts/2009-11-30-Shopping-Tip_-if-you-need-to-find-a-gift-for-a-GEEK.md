I've occasionally [shopped here](<http://www.thinkgeek.com>). I got another
bit of mail from them for so-called Cyber Monday. Looking at the [stuff they
had](<http://www.thinkgeek.com>) (much of which I wanted for myself), I
thought to send out a tip to non-geek friends of geeks who might be struggling
to find a Christmas or Channukah gift for a geek. [Check out
ThinkGeek](<http://www.thinkgeek.com>).
