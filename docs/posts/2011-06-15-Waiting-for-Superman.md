I recently saw the movie "Waiting for Superman" - yes I am late to the party.
But in case you have not seen it let me recommend it to you as a highly
revealing and disappointing view into the way the American school system runs,
stuck in a system that feels so wrong in so many ways. Watch it. And visit the
[Waiting For Superman Web Site.](<http://www.waitingforsuperman.com>)

Here is the IMdb info for [Waiting for
Superman](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1566648/>). Here is the[ Netflix link
for the DVD.](<http://movies.netflix.com/Movie/Waiting-for-
