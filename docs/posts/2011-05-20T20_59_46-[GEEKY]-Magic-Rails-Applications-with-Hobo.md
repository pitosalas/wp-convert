Another tidbit I came across at RailsConf is
[Hobo](<http://www.hobocentral.net/about/>). I haven't tried it myself but did
just go through the screencast and tutorial. I think it's worth a closer look.

The question with these kinds of packages is whether they are flexible in the
right ways or whether they will get in your way when you try to do what you
need to do. I can't answer for sure.

If you are looking for a further accelerator for building Rails apps,
[Hobo](<http://www.hobocentral.net/about/>) is a good option to explore.
