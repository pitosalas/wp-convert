[Netflix has a box to stream video](<http://www.roku.com/netflixplayer/>) into
my living room. TIVO has a deal with Amazon to do the same. [Blockbuster is
just coming out with their set-
top](<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/3527388/Blockbuster-
launches-set-top-box-for-movie-downloads.html>) box. Check out this
interesting option from [Myka:](<http://www.myka.tv/index.html>)

Looks very interesting, especially in it's use of BitTorrent. I don't think
it's shipping just yet, but worth looking into when it does. Read the [wired
article.](<http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/04/myka-one-set-to.html>)
