[David Brooks of the New York Times writes about technology and
risk](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28brooks.html>), in the
context of the drilling disaster in the Gulf:

> "Second, people have a tendency to get acclimated to risk. As the physicist
> Richard Feynman wrote in a report on the Challenger disaster, as years went
> by, NASA officials got used to living with small failures. If faulty O rings
> didn’t produce a catastrophe last time, they probably won’t this time, they
> figured.
>
> Feynman compared this to playing Russian roulette. Success in the last round
> is not a good predictor of success this time. Nonetheless, as things seemed
> to be going well, people unconsciously adjust their definition of acceptable
> risk." ( **from**[Drilling for
> Certainty](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/opinion/28brooks.html>), NYT)
