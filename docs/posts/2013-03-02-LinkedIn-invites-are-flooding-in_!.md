# [LinkedIn invites are flooding in?!](None)




I don't know what's going on, am I suddenly famous? LinkedIn invites are
picking up. I think it's more likely that LinkedIn has come up with a clever
way to encourage people to link to others. I don't know, but I am receiving
LinkedIn invites, from people I never heard of before, and from other cities
and even countries. Whatever, first I was feeling important, now I am starting
to feel a little besieged!
