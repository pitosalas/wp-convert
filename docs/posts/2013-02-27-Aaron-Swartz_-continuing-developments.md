In the continuing stories around Aaron Swartz and events that led to his
tragic suicide recently:

> "Many people speculated throughout the whole ordeal that this was a
> political prosecution, motivated by anything/everything from Aaron’s
> effective campaigning against SOPA to his run-ins with the FBI over the
> PACER database. But Aaron actually didn’t believe it was — he thought it was
> overreach by some local prosecutors who didn’t really understand the
> internet and just saw him as a high-profile scalp they could claim,
> facilitated by a criminal justice system and computer crime laws
> specifically designed to give prosecutors, however incompetent or malicious,
> all the wrong incentives and all the power they could ever want."
