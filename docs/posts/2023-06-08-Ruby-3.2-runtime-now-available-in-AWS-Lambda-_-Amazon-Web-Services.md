**Link: [Ruby 3.2 runtime now available in AWS Lambda | Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/ruby-3-2-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/):** "Get started building with Ruby 3.2 today by making necessary changes for compatibility with Ruby 3.2, and specifying a runtime parameter value of ruby3.2 when creating or updating your Lambda functions."

Really interesting article about now to use Ruby with AWS Lambda.in addition a very useful review of "modern" Ruby features.
