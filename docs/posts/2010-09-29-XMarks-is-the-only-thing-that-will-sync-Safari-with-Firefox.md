And, it's leaving us:

Again this shows how good ideas don't always win.

This was an excellent idea, but perhaps it suffered from the classic-cliche-
VC-quip "It's a feature not a product", or worse, "It's a product not a
company". I don't know how much money, not to mention blood, sweat and tears,
was spent on trying to get it to achieve escape velocity but I can imagine
that it was considerable.

Having built and attracted huge numbers of loyal users is a major
accomplishment, even if it didn't lead to a sustainable business. Kudos and
all the best to the team.
