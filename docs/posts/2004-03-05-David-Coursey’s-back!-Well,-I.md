>> **David Coursey 's back! **Well, I guess I may have been the last to
notice. David wrote what was my favorite punditry column when he was at
Anchordesk. Then he stopped, and I unsubscribed. Now via a pointer from Kevin
W.'s blog I come to see [David's back at it, and right there is his analysis
of Social Networks](<http://reviews-

>> David says that he's been getting tons of LinkedIn invitiations and that
he's flattered, but he often doesn't even remember the person. Oops. I will
send him an email. Let's see if he remembers me ðŸ™‚
