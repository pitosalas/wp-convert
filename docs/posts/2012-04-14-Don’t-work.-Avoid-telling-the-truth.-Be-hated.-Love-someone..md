Ok, I don't agree with all of "[Don’t work. Avoid telling the truth. Be hated.
Love someone"](<http://halfhalf.posterous.com/dont-work-be-hated-love-
someone>):

> "Resist the temptation to get a job. Instead, play. Find something you enjoy
> doing. Do it. Over and over again. You will become good at it for two
> reasons: you like it, and you do it often. Soon, that will have value in
> itself."

but there are some good lessons and reminders in it:

> "Find that pursuit that will energise you, consume you, become an obsession.
> Each day, you must rise with a restless enthusiasm. If you don’t, you are
> working."

I think it's [worth reading.](<http://halfhalf.posterous.com/dont-work-be-
hated-love-someone>)
