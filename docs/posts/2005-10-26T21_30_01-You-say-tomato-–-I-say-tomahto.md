>> The street

>>

>> filled with tomatoes,

>>

>> midday,

>>

>> summer,

>>

>> light is

>>

>> halved

>>

>> like

>>

>> a

>>

>> tomato,

>>

>> its juice

>>

>> runs

>>

>> through the streets.

>>

>> In December,

>>

>> unabated,

>>

>> the tomato

>>

>> invades

>>

>> the kitchen,

>>

>> it enters at lunchtime,

>>

>> takes

>>

>> its ease

>>

>> on countertops,

>>

>> among glasses,

>>

>> butter dishes,

>>

>> blue saltcellars.

>>

>> It sheds

>>

>> its own light,

>>

>> benign majesty.

>>

>> Unfortunately, we must

>>

>> murder it:

>>

>> the knife

>>

>> sinks

>>

>> into living flesh,

>>

>> red

>>

>> viscera

>>

>> a cool

>>

>> sun,

>>

>> profound,

>>

>> inexhaustible,

>>

>> populates the salads

>>

>> of Chile,

>>

>> happily, it is wed

>>

>> to the clear onion,

>>

>> and to celebrate the union

>>

>> we

>>

>> pour

>>

>> oil,

>>

>> essential

>>

>> child of the olive,

>>

>> onto its halved hemispheres,

>>

>> pepper

>>

>> adds

>>

>> its fragrance,

>>

>> salt, its magnetism;

>>

>> it is the wedding

>>

>> of the day,

>>

>> parsley

>>

>> hoists

>>

>> its flag,

>>

>> potatoes

>>

>> bubble vigorously,

>>

>> the aroma

>>

>> of the roast

>>

>> knocks

>>

>> at the door,

>>

>> it's time!

>>

>> come on!

>>

>> and, on

>>

>> the table, at the midpoint

>>

>> of summer,

>>

>> the tomato,

>>

>> star of earth, recurrent

>>

>> and fertile

>>

>> star,

>>

>> displays

>>

>> its convolutions,

>>

>> its canals,

>>

>> its remarkable amplitude

>>

>> and abundance,

>>

>> no pit,

>>

>> no husk,

>>

>> no leaves or thorns,

>>

>> the tomato offers

>>

>> its gift

>>

>> of fiery color

>>

>> and cool completeness.
