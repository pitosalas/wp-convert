# [[GEEKY] Sublime Text surpassing TextMate?](None)




I've been doing some more coding these days in Ruby.

I've had great success and fun (especially when debugging) using
[RadRails](<http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails>), which is an
[Eclipse](<http://www.eclipse.org/>) based IDE for Ruby and Rails. It's quite
nice.

With introduction of [RVM](<http://beginrescueend.com/>),
[bundler](<http://gembundler.com/>), and so on, I've gotten a
[feeling](<https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=radrails%20rvm%20bundler&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8>)
that RadRails maybe too much. It seems to get contexts confused and create
more hassles. I am not sure yet, but it's caused me to go back and use
TextMate, which I've always had in an honored spot in my toolset.

Poking around forums and other resources there seems to be some frustration
that TextMate 2 has not been completed yet, having been 'in development' for I
think over two years. Also there seems to be more and more talk of [Sublime
Text 2](<http://www.sublimetext.com/2>) as a great alternative to TextMate.
Soâ€¦ Here I go. I will report back.
