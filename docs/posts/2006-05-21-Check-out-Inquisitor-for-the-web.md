I've [written](</weblogs/archives/000920.php>) about a **very cool** Safari
(Mac OS X) add-on called Inquisitor. **Very nice**. Well, they now have come
out with Inquisitor for the web, right in your web browser. [Try it
out](<http://www.inquisitorx.com/beta/>), then I don't need to explain it.
Suffice it to say, it's [verry cool](<http://www.inquisitorx.com/beta/>)!
