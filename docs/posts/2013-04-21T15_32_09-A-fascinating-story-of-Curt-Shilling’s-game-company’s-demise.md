This is from the [New York Time's article about Curt Shilling's ill fated game
company "38 Studios":](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/business/curt-
schilling-rhode-island-and-the-fall-of-38-studios.html?smid=pl-share>)

> “It just felt really good, when this all started, to have the sexy sports
> celebrity from Boston who seemed to like Rhode Island and showed up in Rhode
> Island, and who built this exotic new business, even though no one knew what
> it was,” says the historian Ted Widmer, who grew up in Providence and works
> at Brown. “It seemed like the digital economy, or biotech, or whatever. But
> then it turned out that it wasn’t the new digital economy. It was some
> 13-year-old’s medieval fantasy.” ( **from**[The New York

> island-and-the-fall-of-38-studios.html?smid=pl-share>))

Read it, it's a fascinating story.

Oh and I had some comments about the story way back when: ["Can Shilling focus
on 38 studios and still be great for the Red
Sox?"](</imported-20111103233638/2007/7/18/can-shilling-focus-on-38-studios-
and-still-be-a-great-for-th.html>)
