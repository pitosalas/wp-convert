> Produce comes in, too -- 50-pound cases of russets from Idaho stacked head
> high and six deep; spinach, asparagus, celery, mushrooms, tomatoes -- as do
> dry goods, dairy and some 500 pounds of insanely expensive peanut oil for
> the French fries. The restaurant employs six stewards to deal with
> deliveries and storage alone; they weigh goods and check them against
> invoices, putting everything in its proper place, keeping the Health
> Department happy. At a typical restaurant, as much as one-third of the
> overhead goes to food costs, and so efficiency is an imperative. "Monday,
> you'll see," Kelvin Arias, the head steward, tells me, "all the walk-ins
> will be empty."
