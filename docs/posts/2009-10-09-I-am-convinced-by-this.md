Sergey Brin of Google has an op-ed in today's [New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/opinion/09brin.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss>),
making the case for Google Books:

> "But the vast majority of books ever written are not accessible to anyone
> except the most tenacious researchers at premier academic libraries. Books
> written after 1923 quickly disappear into a literary black hole. With rare
> exceptions, one can buy them only for the small number of years they are in
> print. After that, they are found only in a vanishing number of libraries
> and used book stores. As the years pass, contracts get lost and forgotten,
> authors and publishers disappear, the rights holders become impossible to
> track down." ( **from** [A Library to Last
> Forever](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/opinion/09brin.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss>))

Pretty convincing stuff. [Read the whole
