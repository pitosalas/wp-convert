**Link: [PID controller | Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PID_controller):** "A proportional–integral–derivative controller is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value."

Very important control algorithm. Used a lot in robotics but many other ways.
