[ PID controller | Wikiwand](< https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PID_controller>) –A
proportional–integral–derivative controller is a control loop mechanism
employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a
variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID
controller continuously calculates an error value

e {\displaystyle e }

as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable
and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms
, hence the name.
