# [Is Newser this weeks Daylife?](None)




[Newser.com](<http://www.newser.com/>) is a new news site, with the tag line:
"Faster, Smarter News." Seems like it does some kind of automatic
classification of news by one of 9 major topics and organizes it automatically
and attractively. It may or may not be trying to personalize what it displays
for me.

To my eye it is similar to [Daylife.com](<http://www.daylife.com/home>).
Remember Daylife? It flashed pretty good a few months ago, but haven't really
heard much more about it. Again I am not sure whether it does any
personalization or how that works.

As someone who follows these kinds of products pretty closely, I don't
immediately see the key differences. Do you?
