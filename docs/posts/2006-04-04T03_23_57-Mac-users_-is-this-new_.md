Apple just shipped 10.4.6, the **latest revision** to the OS X. This may be
old, but I never noticed that the blue Spotlight menu icon in the top right of
the screen has **a little pulsing dot** in the middle of the magnifying glass,
presumably to tell me that it was busy indexing stuff, presumably explaining
why my computer is running a little hard right now. Is it a **new** little
touch or has it **always been there?
