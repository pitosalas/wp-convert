**Link: [Scalable application design without magic - Leveraging client computing power for high performance with many users](https://willem.com/blog/2020-05-11_scalable-application-design-without-magic/):** "I needed to design a scalable backend infrastructure that could handle lots of concurrent users. I did this by leveraging the client's computing power having it handle most of the user interaction workload."
