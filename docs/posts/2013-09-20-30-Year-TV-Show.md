I just saw that the final "Season" of Mad Men will be delivered in two mini-
seasons, 7 episdodes in 2014 and 7 more in 2015. I had this idea for a TV show
that has not been done yet.

Just like the contrivance of 24 hours is that it occurred over a 24 hour
period, in real time, my show, called 30 Years, occurs over a 30 year time
span, in real time, with the same actors. Here's how it works.

We commit to 30 years (calendar years) of seasons, with 4 epiisodes each. The
actors start out in year 1, and the same ones, appear year after year, so you
actually see them aging and the world changing around them. It's one cogent
story line which is determined up front, but it runs for 30 actual years, 4
episodes at a time.
