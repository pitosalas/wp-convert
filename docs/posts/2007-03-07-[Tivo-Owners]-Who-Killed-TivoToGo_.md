I am a die-hard Tivo user. Yesterday I stumbled across mention that TivoTogo
now worked on Macs, so the promise of watching Tivo'd content on my iPod led
me to waste a couple of hours trying to get it to work.

I am not sure yet, but it looks like TivoTogo is disabled on Tivo Series 3.
It's kind of hard to find anything definitive about this, but in the article
"[Who Killed TivoTogo](<http://www.eff.org/IP/pnp/cablewp.php>)" I read:

> "It's the latest digital media murder mystery: TiVo Series2's
> TiVoToGo[1](<http://www.eff.org/IP/pnp/cablewp.php#1>) enabled limited
> portability of recorded content to PCs and other devices, but the TiVo
> Series3 HD did not include this feature when recently
> released.[2](<http://www.eff.org/IP/pnp/2>) In other words, if you want to
> upgrade to HD, you have to downgrade your TiVo's features." (from
> [EFF.ORG](<http://www.eff.org/IP/pnp/cablewp.php>))
