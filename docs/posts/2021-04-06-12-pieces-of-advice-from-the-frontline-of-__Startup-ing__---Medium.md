**Link: [12 pieces of advice from the frontline of \"Startup-ing\" - Medium](https://medium.com/p/aa2c14912eea):** "Ideas are worthless. Execute. No one wants to sign your NDA. No one cares that you think your idea is so special. Guess what? Any VC or well connected person in Silicon Valley will know 10 other people with the same idea, some of whom will be working on it. Talk to people. Get feedback. Improve your idea. Most importantly make it happen. That is where the value is - execute. "Vision without execution is just hallucination" Henry Ford knew what was up."
