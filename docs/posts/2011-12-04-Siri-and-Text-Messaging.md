# [Siri and Text Messaging](None)




A lot has been written about [Siri (the new voice activated assistant in the
iPhone 4s)](<http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html>). I have to say
that it works surprisingly well. It has been **eerily accurate in properly
transcribing my voice,** although not quite as perfect in understanding what I
am saying.

I just had a 3 message dialog with someone over text messaging using Siri. I
**never ever** would have done that with texting previously but here I went
speaking in **complete sentences** over text messaging and with 100% accurate
recognition. I don't know if the other guy was using Siri but if he wasn't he
must have been annoyed by how quickly I responded with a full sentence ðŸ™‚

It occurs to me that the average length of text messages might become longer
and longer with the advent of services like this. I wonder if that is at least
part of the reason that Apple is now **bypassing** the mobile operators when
doing iPhone to iPhone messaging.
