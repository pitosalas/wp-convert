This news saddens me:

> "Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs resigned today as chief executive
> officer from Apple. His place at the top of the company will be taken by Tim
> Cook, previously Apple's chief operating officer." (from
> [CNET](<http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20096895-248/steve-jobs-steps-
> down-from-apple/#ixzz1VzbhuDYl>))

I hope he's doing alright and is with us for many many years to come.
