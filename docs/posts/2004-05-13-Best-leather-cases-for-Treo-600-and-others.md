# [Best leather cases for Treo 600 and others](None)



>>

>> **Scott Kirsner** turned me on to [Vaja Leather
Products](<http://www.vajacases.com/>). This outfit supplies what look to be
the **coolest possible** leather cases for Treo 600s, other PDAs, Digital
Cameras, Cellphones or what not, that you'd like to attach to your hip. Very
cool for the jet-set. Take a look.
