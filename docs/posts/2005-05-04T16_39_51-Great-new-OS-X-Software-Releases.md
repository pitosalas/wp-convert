>> **_Two of my all time favorite Mac OS X applications just came out with new
releases:_**

>>

>> **[Adium X](<http://www.adiumx.com/>)** is a beautiful multi-IM-service
client. It's based on GAIM but with a true OS X user interface. For PC users,
it's kind of like Trillian but nicer! They just came out with a new version.
The one thing everyone hasn't done yet is to add Skype IM support. They are
coming on strong as a competitive IM network.

>> **[Ecto](<http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/>)** is a beautiful multi-blog-service
authoring tool, in other words, it gives you a nice and rich edior for your
posts. They also have just come out with a new release. For me the key new
feature is Technorati Tags support.
