# [Portland OR smokes](None)




I'm in Portland Oregon for a few days for a conference, and this may be an
unfair sample, but I was amazed to see how many more people seem to be smoking
cigarettes - on the street, in restaurants, etc - than what I am used to in
Boston. Only one data point, but notable. I wonder why.
