"Harry, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Every day, once a day,
give yourself a present. Don't plan it,, don't wait for it, just … let it
happen. Could be a new shirt at the men's store, a catnap in your office
chair, or two cups of good, hot, black coffee…"_([Dale Cooper, in Twin
Peaks](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/quotes>))_

Don't ask me why, the quote just strikes me as funny!
