[ Regexp Preprocessor](< https://pomsky-lang.org/docs/get-
started/introduction/>) –Interesting but not for me. I know regexps are arcane
and confusing but they are well documented and people know them. I put this in
the same bucket as scss and sass and many other helpful pre-processors. Not
for me. Of course, you may not know that C++ started out literally as a C pre-
processor (called cfront) that would generate C. So… The author says: "Summary
of what pomsky is and what it looks like. Pomsky is a language that compiles
to regular expressions. It is currently in an alpha stage and will likely
change in the next few releases."
