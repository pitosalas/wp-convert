This happened: I had a book on my Amazon wish list for several months.

**Yesterday** , I finally **placed** the order at around **3pm** and **today**
the book is in my **hands** , just about 24 hours later. And this is with
regular Prime shipping, which is supposedly two days.

I wonder. Amazon is **pretty clever**. What if they used the presence of a
**book on wish lists as a clue to where to inventory the books,** in effect
pre-positioning them closer to the probable shipping destination. Wouldn't
that be clever?

Of course a book on the wish list may or may not be ordered. And also, you
wouldn't preposition a single book in Massachusetts because **Pito** might
decide to order it.

But let's say you **forecast** that you are likely going to be selling 100
copies of this book in the next 30 days - it was a fairly geeky book, so not
one that would sell in huge numbers. You might put **50** copies in a
warehouse on the west coast and **50** in one on the east coast.

Or you might come up with a probability calculation of where in the US any
particular book or category of book would be ordered from - City by City,
State by State or something like that. And when you received inventory from
the publishers you could **distribute** it according to this forecast.

Or it was just a **fluke** â€¦ Still I am pretty **impressed**.
