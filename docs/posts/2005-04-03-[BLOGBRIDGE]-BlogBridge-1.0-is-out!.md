# [[BLOGBRIDGE] BlogBridge 1.0 is out!](None)



>>

>> **It 's here! **We are officially declaring BlogBridge as a 1.0 product!
The site is updated, the features are solid and we are off to the races. Here
are some personal tidbits about where we are now and what happens next:

>>

>>   * Actually 1.0 has been done for about a week now, and really over the
last 4 weeks we've been much more focused on fixing bugs than anything else.
And if by now you don't know - you can read all about **BlogBridge**
[here](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)and download 1.0
[here.](<http://www.blogbridge.com/install/weekly/blogbridge.jnlp>)

>>

>>   * Meanwhile we are well on the way to the design and planning of
BlogBridge 2.0. Yes, this isn't the **end** of the line, actually it's the
very **beginning**. I think of 1.0 as the minimalist "me too" foundation on
which we can start building the _really cool stuff._ Our focus will be to push
the envelope on **community** aspects of BlogBridge - both the application and
the service.

>>

>>   * BlogBridge is an **open source projec** t. One thing I've learned first
hand with this project is that putting the "open source" shingle out doesn't
immediately bring out a parade of willing volunteers. So it's **exciting** tat
in the last 2 weeks we've gotten several new folks who are seriously
interested in becoming contributors. which is good news because we have much
bigger plans than resources.

>> Anyway, it's an exciting moment. **Stick with us** : we have HIGH hopes!
