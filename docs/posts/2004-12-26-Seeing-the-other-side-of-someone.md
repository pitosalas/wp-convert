Adam Bossworth is a guy who [I've written about
before](</weblogs/archives/000522.html>), in a very technical context. He's
well known in techie circles for many important accomplishments and
contributions. [It is nice to see him writing
](<http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000036.html>)about a totally other
side of him, the side that you of course always knew had to exist, and yet in
his tech industry persona would probably never ever come up. _It 's easy to
agree with what he is saying._
