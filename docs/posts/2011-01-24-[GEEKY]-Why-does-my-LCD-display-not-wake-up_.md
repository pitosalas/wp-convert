**Link: [[GEEKY] Why does my LCD display not wake up?](None):** ""

When my computer turns on it can often take 30 to 120 seconds for my Samsung
LCD display to wake up. Facts of the case:

  * Display is 213T and is something like 3-5 years old

  * Office can be cold

  * I am sure the computer is ready within seconds. It's just waking up. It will play music for example right away.

  * In every other respect the display is fine

  * It has always done this

Do you know?
