Joel Spolsky of Joel on Software gave an outstanding talk at Yale which he has
written up on his blog. For budding Computer Science majors, people getting
into the computer world or business, there is a lot of **good wisdom** to be
found here:

My **favorite passage** is the discussion about the value put on software,
from the perspective of those who are involved in creating it. Here's how he
**introduces** the topic, but you should really **read the whole thing:**

> "Currently, in the battle between the geeks and the suits, the suits are
> winning, because they control the budget, and honestly, I don’t know if
> that’s such a bad thing. The suits recognize that there are diminishing
> returns to fixing bugs. Once the software hits a certain level of quality
> that allows it to solve someone’s problem, that person will pay for it and
> derive benefit out of it." (**from** [Joel on
> Software](<http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/03.html> "Computer
> Science Theory and Practice"))

The talk is in three sections, **read them all!**
