A funny article in the New York Times the other day:

> "[…snap] I HAVE reached a curious point in life. Although I feel like the
> same precocious know-it-all cynic I always was, I suddenly am surrounded by
> younger precocious know-it-all cynics whose main purpose appears to be to
> remind me that I’ve lost my edge.[snap…]" **from** '[omg my mom joined
> facebook](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/fashion/07Cyber.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>)'

I too joined Facebook about a year ago, for 'research purposes'. My experience
was similar:

> "[snap…] After I got my Profile page, the first thing I did was to search
> for other members — my daughter and her friends — to ask them to be my
> friends.

> Shockingly, quite a few of them — the friends, not the daughter — accepted
> my invitation and gave me access to their Profiles, including their
> interests, hobbies, school affiliations and in some cases, physical
> whereabouts. [snap…]" ( **from** '[omg my mom joined
> facebook](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/fashion/07Cyber.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>)')

I too have many friends on Facebook. I haven't friended my son though…
