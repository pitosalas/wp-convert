**Link: [Phone spam, charities and trust](None):** ""

In the [New York Times, an editorial talks about a study that reveals rampant
abuses in certain charitable causes
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/25/opinion/25tue3.html>)(or organizations
passing themselves as such)

> "The public has rightly shown its empathy with wounded and troubled war
> veterans, contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to private charities
> that claim to have the veterans’ best interests at heart. A new study
> details rampant abuses of the money flow." (from [New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/25/opinion/25tue3.html>))

The study referenced is from a very reputable outfit, [Charity Watch.
](<http://www.charitywatch.org/>)

I haven't done a careful comparison, as the names of charities that call my
house have **many very similar sounding names**. But my experience in dealing
with them on the phone has been almost uniformly unpleasant: strange hard-sell
tactics, rudeness, accusations and so on. I had my suspicions and this new
study kind of corroborates them.
