I've always been a major space travel fan and geek. This video linked from
Engadget incredibly had me glued to my seat for almost 40 minutes. Some
fantastic super slow motion footage of the launch.

Note especially how the two narrators just love the shuttle and love their
jobs. They can't get enough of it, even after having seen this stuff a million
times over.
