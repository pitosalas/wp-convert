I've been an avid user and recommender of [Pivotal
Tracker](<https://www.pivotaltracker.com>), an excellent, simple to use, Scrum
based project manager. I still love it a lot. ![Screen Shot 2011 07 29 at 4 49

But, today I came across a very clean and simple alternative called
[Trajectory](<https://www.apptrajectory.com/>).

You may want to check it out. I can't say why we need
[Trajectory](<https://www.apptrajectory.com/>) where we have
[Tracker](<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/>). My guess is that
[Trajectory](<https://www.apptrajectory.com/>) is much less than a scrum
system, maybe it's a structured way to communicate stories and design between
client and developer.

[But wasn't Basecamp for that? ](<http://basecamphq.com/>)
