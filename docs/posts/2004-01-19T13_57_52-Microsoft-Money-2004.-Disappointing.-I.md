>> **Microsoft Money 2004. Disappointing.** I started preparing my taxes and
so I thought I might upgrade my Microsoft Money to the 2004 from 2003. I am a
fairly comprehensive user of Microsoft Money, and so every year I do this, and
frankly almost every year I am disappointed.

>> **There are almost no new features** , enhancements, simplifications or
whatever. **Am I a sucker?** Every year, I probably wait 2 to 3 months after
the upgrade comes out to order itâ€¦ I am well aware of their tack to extract
yet another $50 from me (less the $20 rebate which) but I still fall for it,
in the hope that even if nothing visible changes, bugs are fixed that will
save me time even though I never am aware of it. Still I'd say if you are
thinking of upgrading to 2004, you can **safely skip it.**
