I saw this [article in the Sunday New York Times
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
true.html>)today which starts promising but then becomes a bit ridiculous and
makes a **mockery of serious research,** in my humble opinion.

It starts with a claim that sounds plausible:

> "Recent advances in understanding what psychologists call âembodied
> cognitionâ indicate a surprisingly direct link between mind and body. It
> turns out that people draw on their bodily experiences in constructing their
> social reality.
>
> Studies show, for example, that someone holding a warm cup of coffee tends
> to perceive a stranger as having a "warmer" personality. Likewise when
> holding something heavy, people see things as more serious and important –
> more - weighty" ( **from**[When Truisms are
> True)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
> true.html>)

But then as they go into the studies they are doing to demonstrate some of
their ideas. Just casually I think of many simpler explanations than the far
out conclusions they seem to be coming to:

> "For example, we asked 102 undergraduates at New York University to complete
> a task designed to measure innovative thinking. The task required them to
> generate a word (âtape,â for example) that related to each of three
> presented clue words (âmeasure,â âwormâ and âvideoâ). Some
> students were randomly assigned to do this while sitting inside a 125-cubic-
> foot box that we made of plastic pipe and cardboard. The rest got to sit and
> think outside (and next to) the box.
>
> During the task we tracked the number of correct responses suggested by the
> students. We found that those thinking outside the box were significantly
> more creative: compared with those thinking inside the box, they came up
> with over 20 percent more creative solutions." ( **from**[When Truisms are
> True)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
> true.html>)

and

> "Then we asked them to think of original uses for the objects, either while
> walking along a fixed rectangular path indicated by duct tape on the floor
> (marking out an area of about 48 square feet) or by walking freely as they
> wished. The differences were striking: students who walked freely were
> better at generating creative uses for the objects â coming up with over
> 25 percent more original ideas. Such creativity was assessed in terms of
> fluency (the number of ideas generated), flexibility (the number of unique
> categories that described the generated ideas) and originality (as judged by
> independent raters)." ( **from**[When Truisms are
> True)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
> true.html>)

**Really**? It was at this point that I looked back at the article's start to
check if this was Humor or Satire.
