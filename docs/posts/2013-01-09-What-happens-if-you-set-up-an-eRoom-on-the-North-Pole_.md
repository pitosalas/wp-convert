Here's a new product I just saw, [Igloo](<http://www.igloosoftware.com/tour>).
It's very nice and it reminds me of what eRoom might have looked like if we
designed it 15 years later. They have a beautiful product. Here's what they
say:

> At its core, Igloo is about communication: In your day, you might give
> updates, have discussions and share files with your team. With Igloo, that
> all happens in one place. Igloo helps you communicate in an elegant and
> integrated digital workplace. You get visibility into what's happening
> throughout your whole team and your whole office. (**From** I[gloo Web Site
> tour)](<http://www.igloosoftware.com/tour>)
