[ Sharding your database](<https://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/11/30/sharding-
your-database/>)

I’m increasingly encountering users on Heroku that are encountering the need
to [shard](https://ift.tt/c7m6Yfs) their data. For most users this is
something you delay as long as possible as you can generally go for sometime
before you have to worry about it. Additionally scaling up your database is
often a reasonable approach early on and something I encourage as a starting
point as scaling up is easy to do with regards to databases. However, for the
1% of users that do need to shard when the time comes many are left wondering
where to start, hence the following guide.
