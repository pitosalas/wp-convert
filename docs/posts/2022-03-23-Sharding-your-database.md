(**Web site excerpt:** I’m increasingly encountering users on Heroku that are encountering the need to [shard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)) their data. For most users this is something you delay as long as possible as you can generally go for sometime before you have to worry about it. Additionally scaling up your database is often a reasonable approach early on and something I encourage as a starting point as scaling up is easy to do with regards to databases. However, for the 1% of users that do need to shard when the time comes many are left wondering where to start, hence the following guide.)
