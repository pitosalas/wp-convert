**Link: [Ruby's Hash is a Swiss-Army Knife](https://www.akshaykhot.com/ruby-hash-is-a-swiss-army-knife/?ref=akshays-blog-newsletter):** "A Hash is a built-in data structure in Ruby that maps values to keys and has a constant-time O(1) lookup. This article shows the capabilities of this simple, but equally powerful tool. Weâ€™ll start with the basics but also cover some obscure but equally useful features of hash." 

A nice review of all the things Ruby hashes can do and be used for.
