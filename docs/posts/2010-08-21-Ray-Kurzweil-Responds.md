You may not have followed the discussion that ensued when Ray Kurzweil was
reported to '[not understand the
brain](<http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/08/ray_kurzweil_does_not_understa.php>)',
but it's pretty fascinating. Here's what PZ Meyers said:

> "There he goes again, making up nonsense and making ridiculous claims that
> have no relationship to reality. Ray Kurzweil must be able to spin out a
> good line of bafflegab, because he seems to have the tech media convinced
> that he's a genius, when he's actually just another Deepak Chopra for the
> computer science cognoscenti." ( **from** [PZ

Ouch!

Here's a typically articulate and persuasive rebuttal from Ray Kurzweil:

> "Myers, who apparently based his second-hand comments on erroneous press
> reports (he wasn’t at my talk), goes on to claim that my thesis is that we
> will reverse-engineer the brain from the genome. This is not at all what I
> said in my presentation to the [Singularity
> Summit](<http://singularitysummit.com/>). I explicitly said that our quest
> to understand the principles of operation of the brain is based on many
> types of studies — from detailed molecular studies of individual neurons, to
> scans of neural connection patterns, to studies of the function of neural
> clusters, and many other approaches. I did not present studying the genome
> as even part of the strategy for reverse-engineering the brain." ( **from**
