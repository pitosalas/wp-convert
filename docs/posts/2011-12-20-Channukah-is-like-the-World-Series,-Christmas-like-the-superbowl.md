Ned Batchelder, my pal, points out that:

> "Like the Super Bowl, Christmas is one concentrated day. For celebrants, it
> is the only thing happening that day, and it's preceded by weeks of
> anticipation and preparation. Another similarity is the zeal with which
> businesses try to piggy-back on the excitement." ( **from** [Ned
> Batchelder's
> Blog)](<http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201112/happy_hanukkah.html>)

He ends sweetly:

> "While the daylight passes as it normally would, the evenings are spent
> specially, and the entire week is tinged with a special feeling because of
> it. If you have to miss one night for another reason, that's OK, you've got
> others you can celebrate." ( **from** [Ned Batchelder's
> Blog)](<http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201112/happy_hanukkah.html>)

(yeah, you heard me, I called Ned sweet 🙂
