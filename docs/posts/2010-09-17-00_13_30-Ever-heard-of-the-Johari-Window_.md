I came across the idea of the [Johari
Window](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window>) during one of the
presentations at the Bif-6 Conference. I'd never heard of it before. To me
it's an interesting formalism to think about ones self knowledge. Reading
about the Johari Window on Wikipedia (where else) but it was an interesting
way to understanding personality.

Who knows if this approach (reminiscent a little bit of Myers Brigss) is well
known, respected or in total disrepute. It spoke to me, so I thought I would
share it.
