[Bill Ives of the Portals and KM Blog](<http://billives.typepad.com/>) writes
an interesting two-part article on the business impact of Web 2.0:

> "Now with Web 2.0 the open architecture, the refinement of web services, and
> the ability to put together applications through mashups makes the basic
> development costs much lower and time to market much quicker. More effort
> can be placed on making the tools actually serve business and consumer
> needs. Startups now can also benefit from looking back at the mistakes and
> successes of the first generation." from [Portals and KM: The Business
> Impact of Web 2.0: Part
> One](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/2007/07/business-
> impact.html>).

Bill also covers a discussion with [Elliot
Katzman](<http://ccvlp.com/get.asp?section=12&get=20>) of Commonwealth Capital
Ventures about the difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 from a business
investment perspective using My Team of Active Network as a case study.
Ellliot, by the way, was the original founder of My Team before it was
acquired by Active Network.
