>> It's been quiet but we've been busy. We are getting ready to put up a major
new revision of BlogBridge with goodies such as drag and drop of Channels,
Collapse/Expand groups of articles, based on age, Next Unread processing, a
bunch of new User Preferences. Also we are doing a bit of a reorganization of
this site. The 'Tasks' page has become a nuisance to maintain and really not
that useful, so it's gone. And the Specs page is being totally revised to be
more useful. Expect lots of additions to the Specs page as we move into
another phase of development.
