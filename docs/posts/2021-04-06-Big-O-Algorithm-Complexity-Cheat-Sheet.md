(**Web site excerpt:** Hi there!&nbsp; This webpage covers the space and time Big-O complexities of common algorithms used in Computer Science.&nbsp; When preparing for technical interviews in the past, I found myself spending hours crawling the internet putting together the best, average, and worst case complexities for search and sorting algorithms so that I wouldn't be stumped when asked about them.&nbsp; Over the last few years, I've interviewed at several Silicon Valley startups, and also some bigger companies, like Yahoo, eBay, LinkedIn, and Google, and each time that I prepared for an interview, I thought to msyelf "Why oh why hasn't someone created a nice Big-O cheat sheet?".&nbsp; So, to save all of you fine folks a ton of time, I went ahead and created one.&nbsp; Enjoy!)
