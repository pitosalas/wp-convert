(Non-users of BlogBridge, this wil not be interesting to you. But you have to
ask yourself, why are you not using it?) As most everyone who uses BlogBridge
seems to be subscribed to my Blog I thought posting a tip or news every so
often might be a way to expose some thinking about BlogBridge to you all, so
starting today I will be posting a regular item that I think would be of
interest. We very recently added a command to the Help menu, "Send Feedback"
which we encourage you to use if you have any thought, complaint, bug report,
or whatever that you would like to share with us. Just enter your text in the
box and that's all there is to it. Note that we have plenty of users who are
regularly sending us feedback with email but still that's only a fraction of
all our users so we thought we should make it easier. Please have a go at the
new Send Feedback command on the Help menu! (By the way, if you want to send
us email that is totally welcome too. This email is also read by the
development team: blogbridge-devl@lists.sourceforge.net.
