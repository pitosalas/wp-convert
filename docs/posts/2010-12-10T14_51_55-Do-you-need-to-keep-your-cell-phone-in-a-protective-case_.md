Check out this really interesting [Pogue article in the New York Times:
"Gorilla Glass, the Smartphone's Unsung
Hero"](<http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/gorilla-glass-the-
smartphones-unsung-hero/?partner=rss&emc=rss>). Here's a tidbit:

> “It’s the screen of every touchscreen phone, like the iPhone and Android
> phone, plus the iPad and iPod Touch. It’s an amazing story. Corning invented
> this stuff in the ’60s, but didn’t know what to do with it. Then a few years
> ago, someone showed a piece of it to Steve Jobs. The guy dropped a piece of
> the glass into a bag full of keys and shook it hard; it came out without a
> scratch on it! Jobs immediately seized on the idea of using it for his
> iPhone. Today, Apple buys practically all the Gorilla Glass that Corning can
> make. Apple is the world’s No. 1 consumer of it.” ( **from** [Pogue article
