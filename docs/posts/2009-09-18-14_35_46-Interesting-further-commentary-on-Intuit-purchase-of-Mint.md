I [wrote about the Mint/Intuit deal](</2009/09/15/mint-being-acquired-by-
intuit-good-or-bad/>) the other day. Being an avid user, I had mixed feelings
about this development. I came across this [good post about the
transaction](<http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1927-the-next-generation-bends-
over>), which puts a decidedly negative spin on it:

> "Mint was a key leader of the next generation of game changers. And now it’s
> property of Intuit — the poster-child for the last generation. What a loss.
> Is that the best the next generation can do? Become part of the old
> generation? How about kicking the shit out of the old guys? What ever
> happened to that?" ( **from** [The Next Generation Bends
> Over](<http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1927-the-next-generation-bends-over>))

A bit harsh to be sure. Read the comment stream, there are some interesting
points and counter points made, such as:

> "Every company, including Intuit, should have the opportunity to reinvent
> itself (if, in fact, this is part of what they’re hoping to do). In fact, a
> sign of a great company is one that can change. I don’t mind giving Intuit
> the chance to do that, regardless that they were “last decade’s leader”.
>
> As a MINT user, the only real question I had was whether I trust my data in
> the hands of Intuit. I have decided to take that chance until I learn
> something differently."(from [jonathan](<http://blog.oceanic.com.fj/>))
