* **Web site excerpt:** There are many iOS prototyping tools out there: Briefs 2, POP, Prototypr just to name a few. The one that really struck me as the most efficient is Flinto by far. Ironically, itâ€™s the only Web-based tool amongst them. And there is nothing better out there. It will literally take minutes to create a prototype that looks like it was made using Xcode Storyboard.
