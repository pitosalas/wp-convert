This [site looks really good](<http://www.billguard.com/>), but I am not
signing up yet.

I am famously promiscuous signing up with new services just so I can 'know
what's going on', but when the first thing I have to do is to give this site
my account and password for a credit card that I use, I stop and take a
breath.

Who are these guys? [Fred Wilson, a highly reputable VC blogger is the one who
recommended it in his
blog.](<http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AVc/~3/Rw41-xc_4ps/billguard.html>)
Maybe he's an investor? I don't know. But for now, I am holding off.
