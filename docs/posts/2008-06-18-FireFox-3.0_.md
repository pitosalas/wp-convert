I got the big new release of FireFox 3.0. Looks fine. Actually looks mostly
the same. I am not sure what the big changes are but I am trying it out to see
how it goes.

I know one regular headache with FireFox for me has been that it would pin the
CPU for no apparent reason. The closest I came to seeing a pattern is that it
seemed to have to do with pages being opened that had Flash scripts on them.
But I can't say I ever verified that. All I know is that fairly regularly when
my system got slow, I would see FireFox at the top.

If that's all that FF3.0 fixes, that would be enough for me.

Update: I just saw this [link about FireFox
