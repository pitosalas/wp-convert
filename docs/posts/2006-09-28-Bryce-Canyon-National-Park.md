> As promised here is the first of the collection of posts inspired on my
> recent trip. All I can say is "Utah is an amazing place." This is one of my
> favorite pictures taken at Bryce. It looks otherworldly to me… If you [check

> see the other pictures that I took while out there. I actually took over 400
> so this was my first attempt at identifying the 100 best. Still sorting.

> Anyway, as you can see from the picture,
> [Bryce](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Canyon>) is barren land, but
> amazing colors. Like many of the places we went to, it's basically a desert.
> The geologic structures seen here and elsewhere have to do with the fact
> [that this section of Utah sits on the so-called Colorado plateau which was
> uplifted to 6-7 and -8 thousand feet at some part in the distant
> future](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Canyon#Creation_of_the_park>).
> The red, by the way, is sandstone with iron content, oxidized.

> As I said, Utah is awesome, check it out sometime!
