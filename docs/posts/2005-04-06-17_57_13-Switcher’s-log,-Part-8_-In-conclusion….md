**I love the fact that I switched to Mac.**

>>

>> A lot of the **fun** is that it's **new** and **different**. Also I like
the idea that there's **UNIX** beneath the skin because I wanted to get more
familiar with it. Also all the applications are ' **prettier** ' to look at
and that's fun.

>>

>> Of course the machine is **blindingly** fast but that's just because its so
much newer than the pc it replaced. It is clearly more stable than Windows XP.

>>

>> But, it's **not all perfect** :

>>

>> It does **crash** sometimes, in mysterious ways. On Windows, I'd be
impressed (and **nervous** ) after about 3 days of uptime. On Mac that figure
is more like 10 days. But stories about it staying up 6 months at a **time don
't seem true**.

>>

>> Also I don't understand the internals nearly as well so when some app
misbehaves it's more mysterious to me. No cranking up of **regedit** and so
on. I am gradually picking up how this works, but I am a long way behind where
I was on Windows.

>>

>> The menu stuck to the top of the primary monitor is still **ridiculous**.
The fact that there are so many keyboard shortcuts that you need to know to be
efficient is silly. And that you have this tiny resize corner control instead
of being able to use all edges to resize is also primitive.

>>

>> Net net - its a lot of fun, and **I am glad I did it**. If I was doing
different kind of work I might **think different** 🙂 But I am **not** in the
camp that says that OS X is simply superior to Windows XP. I would say it's
different, in a **good** way.
