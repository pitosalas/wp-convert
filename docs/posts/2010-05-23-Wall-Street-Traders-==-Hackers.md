**Link: [Wall Street Traders == Hackers](None):** ""



[Mark Cuban comes up with a very plausible
analogy:](<http://www.businessinsider.com/what-business-is-wall-street-
in-2010-5>)

> "The best analogy for traders  ? **They are hackers**. Just as hackers
> search for and exploit operating system and application shortcomings,
> traders do the same thing.  A hacker wants to jump in front of your shopping
> cart and grab your credit card and then sell it.  A high frequency trader
> wants to jump in front of your trade and then sell that stock to you. A
> hacker will tell you that they are serving a purpose by identifying the weak
> links in your system. A trader will tell you they deserve the pennies they
> are making on the trade because they provide liquidity to the market. (

The [Sunday New York Times today suggests a similar conclusion but not the
perfect analogy:
