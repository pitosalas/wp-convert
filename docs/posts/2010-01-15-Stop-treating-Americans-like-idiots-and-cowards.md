An [excellent article in the Wall Street Journal about the way the media and
politicians want us to react to the recent Christmas Day attempted terrorist
attack](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704130904574644651587677752.html>).

> "No amount of statistical evidence, however, will make any difference to
> those who give themselves over to almost completely irrational fears. Such
> people, and there are apparently a lot of them in America right now, are in
> fact real victims of terrorism. They also make possible the current
> ascendancy of the politics of cowardiceâ€”the cynical exploitation of fear for
> political gain." (**from** [Paul Campos writing in the Wall Street
> Journal](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704130904574644651587677752.html>))

Bruce Schneier, as usual has a lucid and convincing commentary on the article:

> "But as a nation we get to set our priorities, and decide how to spend our
> money. No one is suggesting we ignore the risks of terrorism -- and making
> people [feel safe](<http://www.schneier.com/essay-154.html>) is a good thing
> to do -- but it makes no sense to focus so much effort and money on it when
> there are far worse risks to Americans." (**from** [Bruce Shneier's
> blog](<http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/the_comparative.html>))

He is always lucid and convincing. Here is a recent column in [CNN, "Stop the
Panic on air
security":](<http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/07/schneier.security/index.html>)

> "As circular as it sounds, rare events are rare primarily because they don't
> occur very often, and not because of any preventive security measures. If
> you want to do something that makes security sense, figure out what's common
> among a bunch of rare events, and concentrate your countermeasures there."

> CNN](<http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/07/schneier.security/index.html>))
