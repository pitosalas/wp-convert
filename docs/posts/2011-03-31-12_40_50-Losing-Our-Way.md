This [New York Times Op-Ed piece by Bob
Herbert](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/opinion/26herbert.html?_r=1&ref=bobherbert>)
really hits home:

> "The U.S. has not just misplaced its priorities. When the most powerful
> country ever to inhabit the earth finds it so easy to plunge into the horror
> of warfare but almost impossible to find adequate work for its people or to
> properly educate its young, it has lost its way entirely." ( **from**
> [Losing Our
> Way](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/opinion/26herbert.html?_r=1&ref=bobherbert>))

It's called ["Losing Our
Way"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/opinion/26herbert.html?_r=1&ref=bobherbert>).
You should read it.
