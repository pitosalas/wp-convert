Just wonderin' -- the iPod Shuffle has a really cool feature where a
synthesized voice will announce the name of a song over the earphones upon
request. Super useful feature on any iPod, right? Then how come is it not
available on the far more powerful and expensive iPhone? Is there a technical
reason or a marketing reason or some other mysterious reason?
