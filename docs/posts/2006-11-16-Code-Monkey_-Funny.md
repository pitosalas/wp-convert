>> "Thing a Week is a project I've been working on since September 2005 in
which I record and post a song a week as a podcast. It's a way for me to keep
the creative juices flowing as freely as possible, and a way for me to push
myself to take risks, work quickly and trust in the creative process. It's
also a form of protest - I will keep doing this until someone pays me to do
it." ( **from** [Thing a Week](<http://jonathancoulton>))
