Check out the [latest summary of amazing feats
](<http://www.blogbridge.com/products-services/blogbridge/visual-tour/>)by
BlogBridge. I don't want to be too cheeky, but there are some pretty cool
things that you get from BlogBridge (for free) that you can't get anywhere
else.

BlogBridge is definitely a serious tool which is why I bit my tongue and
marked this post 'geeky' but really it's also, as you know, my labor of love,
so I can't resist showing it off. [Hope you take a moment to try
it!](<http://www.blogbridge.com/look>)
