Yup. [I wrote about this before. And I agree](</2010/11/12/overreaction/>). At
this point we've gone too far in (pretending to) make it impossible for a
terrorist hit of some kind. We can't prevent it at 100% and the way we are
going at it and the direction it's taking us is not acceptable. Unfortunately
there's something about our political discourse that makes taking this
position a hard one for an actual political 'leader' to espouse.
