[David Mamet (supposedly) wrote this compelling note to tv
writers](<http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/03/23/a-letter-from-david-mamet-to-
the-writers-of-the-unit/>) for the now-defunct tv show "The Unit" (which I
thought was a really good tv show.) If you like TV you will enjoy reading
this. Gems such as:

> "THE PROBLEM IS THIS: TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN *DRAMA* AND NON-DRAMA. LET ME
> BREAK-IT-DOWN-NOW."
>
> "ANY TIME ANY CHARACTER IS SAYING TO ANOTHER “AS YOU KNOW”, THAT IS, TELLING
> ANOTHER CHARACTER WHAT YOU, THE WRITER, NEED THE AUDIENCE TO KNOW, THE SCENE
> IS A CROCK OF SHIT."

And much much more. See "[Letter From David Mamet".
