This idea sounds ok but there are a lot of issues with bringing it about. Will it bring out a new, singular, ethical concept sitting along side “original work” and “plagiarism”? Here is the author: “My drawings are a reflection of my soul. What happens when artificial intelligence — and anyone with access to it — can replicate them?”
