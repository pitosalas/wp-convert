**Link: [[GEEKY] How to use Twitter in Rails](None):** ""



This looks like a really nice and detailed [tutorial on how to use Twitter in
Rails](<http://pedromtavares.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/integrating-rails-with-
twitter/>). Check it out! p.s. if you don't know what the previous sentence
means, don't worry about it. You must not really be geeky.
