Pretty amazing that the govt is actually placing [all the code for
healthcare.gov on github for all of us to
inspect](<https://github.com/CMSgov/healthcare.gov>). There's only one commit,
and it's 3 months old. Also there's a [reasonable amount of developer
information available. ](<https://www.healthcare.gov/developers/>)

[](<https://www.healthcare.gov/developers/>)Somehow I suspect that it is not
*all* there or how fast it will be updated, but still whatever's there is a
big step forward from the SOP of the past!
