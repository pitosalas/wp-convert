readers can easily be confused by multiple tags, mis-counting or mis-
identifying.

as real enough to effect the kind of **rapid industry change** that fans of

>> That said, while I am a fence-sitter, I do think that RF-ID technology is
very important and represents a real sea-change. I just think that it will
take much longer than people think.(Remember one of my [standard nuggets, it's
easy to predict the future](</2004/01/09.html>), what's hard is predicting

adopt to RF-ID.
