>> My new cellphone **supposedly** has GPS capabilities. It has to do,
apparently with the new [E-911](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_911>)
standard, which requires a cell phone to be able to tell emergency responders
where a cell call is coming from.

>>

>> I'm a pretty big GPS aficionado and I thought GPSs had to have these
**big** ugly antennas, **complex** expensive circuitry, and **lots** of
software. I don't understand how all that stuff can be crammed into a tiny
little phone.

>>

>> So I got to thinking that they were just using the term 'GPS' **loosely** ,
and that instead what was going on is a much more **simplistic** triangulation
between cell towers which, I suppose could produce a rough location reading.
Apparently I was **wrong**!

>> Now, here come Sprint and
[Garmin](<https://mobile.garmin.com/obn/learnMore.jsp>), with a turn-by-turn
navigation application that runs on my new phone. [It looks pretty
cool!](<https://mobile.garmin.com/obn/demo.jsp>)

>>

>> What a **rip-off** : $9.99 per month!

>>

>> I **can 't wait** to try it ðŸ™‚
