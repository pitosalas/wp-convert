If you were intrigued by my previous post about the Clock of the Long Now, I
came across a [nice, philosophical and instructive
article](<http://www.michaelchabon.com/column/archives/2006/01/the_omega_glory.html>)
about it:

>
> "But even if the Clock of the Long Now fails to last ten thousand years,
> even if it breaks down after half or a quarter or a tenth that span, this
> mad contraption will already have long since fulfilled its purpose.
>
> Indeed the Clock may have accomplished its greatest task before it is ever
> finished, perhaps without ever being built at all." (**from** [The Omega
> Glory](<http://www.michaelchabon.com/column/archives/2006/01/the_omega_glory.html>)
