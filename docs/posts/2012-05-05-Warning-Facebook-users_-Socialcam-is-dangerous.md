On Facebook you may see something like "George Harrison is **watching a video
on Socialcam** " followed by a video.

Beware because if you watch that video by clicking on it, ALL your friends
will now see that you watched it too.

On two occasions in the last few weeks, some pretty **embarassing** videos
were watched by otherwise highly **respectable** people. **Funny**.
