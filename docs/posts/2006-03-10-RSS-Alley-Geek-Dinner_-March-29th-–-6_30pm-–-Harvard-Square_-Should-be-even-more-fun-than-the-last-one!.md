>>

>> Hello sports fans. We are having another super-informal-geeky-but-not-
exclusively-geeks geek dinner, this time using the well-known PaB/Free
Pattern.

>>

>> Who is we, again? [Bela Labovitch](<http://blogs.opml.org/BelaLabovitch>),
[Adam Green](<http://www.darwinianweb.com/>) and me. We are fortunate that the
folks at [Top Ten
Sources](<http://www.toptensources.com/toptensources/home.aspx>) and RSS Labs
are again letting use their space. **Thanks**!

>>

>> What happens at this thing? Well this is the second one that _we_ are
organizing. Basically we just hang out, casually munch on cheap food and
compare notes on stuff that people are working on.

>>

>> Everyone is welcome, **and people who came last time** : invite along a
friend who didn't come or didn't know about it. **Really**! It would be nice
to have new faces.

>>

>> There's no agenda. We might go around and show off folks latest creations,
or not. At any rate we will provide projection facilities for you to use. But
this is not primarily a demo-rama, it's more of a network-o-rama.

>>

>> See you there!

>>

>> Here are the coordinates:

>>

>>> **When** : March 29, Wednesday, 6:30pm to 9:30pm

>>>

>>> **Where** : 66 Church Street, Cambridge (near Fire and Ice)

>>>

>>> **Topics of discussion:** Web 2.0, RSS, OPML 2.0, AJAX, Ruby, Mashups, Web
Services, Startups, etc.
