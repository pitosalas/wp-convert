(**Web site except:** This seems like a very nice simple tool to solve a common problem. My only confusion is that there are a bunch of similar tools to do the same thing. Each has its own DSL, written in ruby or some other language, has its own conceptual steucture, and its own bugs. It’s enough to make me decide to just keep doing it by hand.  Heres what the author says: “ Prepper is a simple server provisioning tool, built on top of SSHKit.
