**Link: [huginn/huginn: Create agents that monitor and act on your behalf.](https://github.com/huginn/huginn#getting-started):** "Interesting package although I don't have a use for it yet. It's your own IFTTT built for geeks that you run on your ownn server. It's got no UI to speak of. On the other hand, it has a sophisticated way to create logic around events and is extensible and open source."
