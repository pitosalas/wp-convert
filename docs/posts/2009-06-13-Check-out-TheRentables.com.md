I was shown a promising new site called
[TheRentables](<http://www.therentables.com/about.php>), for people (I know at
least 3) who are looking to rent an apartment. They say:

"The Rentables takes a fundamentally different approach to rental property
listings to deliver the most relevant, accurate and comprehensive housing
information to anyone at any time." (from [About
TheRentables](<http://www.therentables.com/about.php>))

I looked in Brooklyn, New York, and there were no listings (they are in the
very early stages) But in [Boston there were some
listings](<http://newengland.therentables.com/?lat=42.3589&lng=-71.0578&init=1&region=boston,%20MA>).
The site looks useful. Now the trick is to get landlords to enter their
information.Technorati Tags:
