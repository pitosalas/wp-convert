I was following a series of articles about the Brazilian e-voting system,
which apparently underwent a white-hat hack test and survived. It started with
this Slashdot article, "[Hackers Fail to Crack Brazillian Voting
Machines"](<http://yro.slashdot.org/story/09/11/14/1936200/Hackers-Fail-To-
Crack-Brazilian-Voting-
Machines?from=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Slashdot%2Fslashdot+%28Slashdot%29>)
Problem is that the original article is in Portugese (although remarkably well
translated by Google Translation) and is a general news article, without
technical specifics.

This took me to this [Slashdot article about how elections in Brazil are
running on Linux
boxes](<http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/10/07/0029224&tid=266>).
Interesting, and essentially what we at the [OSDV](<http://www.osdv.org>) are
embarking on. But I was still not satisfied because I was not familiar with
the source of the stories and wasn't sure how much to believe everything I was
reading. There was also a link to an interesting [wikipedia article about
Elections in
Brazil.](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Brazil#The_Brazilian_voting_machines>)

Finally I wound myself to an article from the [BBC, originally written in
English, which talks about the Brazilian E-Voting
system](<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7644751.stm>). The article is
from last year and is more of an overview of the Brazilian system and does not
talk about the white-hat test.

The final quote was, I felt, the most **significant** in a way:

> " _" The main value of the system is that our society believes in it,"_ he
> said" ( **from** [How Brazil has put an 'e' in
> vote](<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7644751.stm>))

This quote, from a Mr. Rocha, the engineer who created the first electronic
ballot boxes in Brazil, is especially significant to me, because it expresses
what I believe too, which is, no matter how good or perfect voting systems
are, cryptographically, scientifically or technically, in the end, **nothing
will work if there 's not a general feeling of confidence and trust in it**.

An analogy: I drive across a bridge, not because I believe that the engineer
that designed it is infallible (don't have time to think about that) or that
in fact, it can never fail (there might be an earthquake at just that instant)
but, just because, at the core, I have confidence and trust in the system that
put that bridge there.

Which is why one needs to be careful about **systematically sowing distrust
and fear about** elections based on exotic technical arguments. Just a
personal opinion.
