[Control The Sun!](<http://www.mylanderpages.com/sunrise_blinds/olin>)

As you know, I am teaching a course at Olin College this spring - alas we are
coming to the end. Anyway an important component has been a Lean Startup
project, where students take invent a product and take it through a complete
Lean Startup validation. Among many things that students do is to 'go outside
the building' to validate their businesses.

Do me a great favor and help a team of students validate their idea,[ "Sunrise
Blinds", and answer this super easy
questionnaire!](<http://www.mylanderpages.com/sunrise_blinds/olin>)
