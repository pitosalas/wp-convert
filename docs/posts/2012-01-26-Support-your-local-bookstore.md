I have a **warm spot** in my heart for independent bookstores, as such a store
**paid for my college education.** My family business was a bookstore. It is
no longer around however, having gone out of business years ago. Blame
**Amazon**?

Secondly, I read **lots of books** , and own even more. (Yes that implies that
I buy books that I don't read. I don't feel bad about that. I **enjoy**
books.)

Thirdly, I love, I mean, I **LOVE** Amazon.com. What convenience, what great
prices, what free shipping. I even own some AMZN stock. In truth I bet in the
last year I **spent more money on books** at Amazon than from local
bookstores.

See the **conundrum** coming?

Whenever I am in a strange town, or out 'shopping' or on vacation, I can spend
lots of time browsing bookstores. I will **buy books** sometimes, and
sometimes I will write down book titles for later consideration, or **even
later Amazonning.** Ok, so I am **conflicted** about this whole thing.

I would be very sad to see the local bookstore close.

Oh wait, the local bookstore in the town I live closed years ago. (We still
have a used bookstore, which I frequent.)

I don't have a punchline. I am not sure how I feel about this. Should I stop
shopping at Amazon and give up the convenience and good prices? Should I
**never order a book** on Amazon that I first saw in a local bookstore?

Here are **three articles** on this very topic, for your fascination:

perhaps a fantasy.
