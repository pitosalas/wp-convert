**Pecking order? Puleeze!**[Joi Ito
writes](<http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/02/12/pecking_at_etech.html>) with
apparent confusion about the a comment from [Russel Beattie who commented
that](<http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006105.html>): "but boy it
seemed like there were some serious pecking orders there." (via [Jeremy
Zawodny](<http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001576.html>).) While
Russel's comment is about ETech, a conference I am really sorry I had to miss,
it **certainly doesn 't surprise** me, as it shouldn't surprise Joi or others.

>> In fact I am always **amused** and **bemused** (what's the difference?) at
the highly **structured** set of social behaviors are exhibited at conferences
such as ETech (but equally at Agenda, PC Forum, Demo and I am sure all the
others.) I am sure it is in evidence **wherever human beings** gather:
academia, the US congress, **high school** and on and on and on. It's kind of
funny if people didn't take it so seriously.

>> Without spending too much time on it, see if you recognize any of these
dances: the "I **pretend** not to notice the fact that you are trying to get a
word in edgewise and just keep on talking." or the "You turn to face the
person you are focusing on (the higher peckee) and actually turn **your back**
to the one you are trying to ignore (the lower peckee - or is it pecker?)" or
how about the "Wait here while I go refill my drink, (and never return.)."
Some day I should write an article!
