**Link: [What is Pinterest good for?](None):** ""

Funny thing, I like many people are trying to figure out what
[Pinterest](<www.pinterest.com>) is good for. Well I found a use.

From yesterday's post, you saw that I am searching for a new application icon
for [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>). In fact I listed a series of
out/crowdsource design options. What I need to do now is to provide them with
design guidance, a design brief.

So as you may imagine, I've been looking around the web for icons and logos
which I like because one of the best ways to tell a designer what you are
looking for is to show them the stuff you like.

See where this is going?

Voila, what better use for [Pinterest](<www.pinterest.com>) can you think of?

**[Here's my Pinterest "BlogBridge Icon Inspiration"
Board](<http://pinterest.com/pitosalas/blogbridge-icon-inspiration/>)**

I will try to set it up so you can add an idea or two if you have any
contribution. Whoops, that might be dangerous. Shall we try?
