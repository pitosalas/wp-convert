**Link: [Good coverage of friends of mine](None):** ""



Recently three friends of mine got nice press coverage, so I thought I'd share
them:

  * [Reed Sturtevant is doing some great things at Microsoft in Boston](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2008/06/30/microsoft_seeks_next_big_idea_in_cambridge/>)

  * [Paul Engiish and Kayak are showing the true prices of air travel](<http://www.boston.com/business/personalfinance/articles/2008/06/26/flustering_fares/>)

  * [Ted Morgan of Skyhook are performing magic with photos and no-GPS](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/technology/personaltech/26pogue.html?_r=1&8dpc=&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin>)

So in fact, there IS cool tech stuff going on in Boston ðŸ™‚
