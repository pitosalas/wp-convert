# [Gmail spam filtering degraded?](None)



>>

>> In the last few weeks or so, I've noticed a marked increase in the number
of spam emails that are making it into my Gmail inbox. It would be very
interesting to know how the spammers vs. Google arms race is going. I've got
to believe that Google is working hard on the problem, but given that this
[was one of the main benefits, at least for me, of going to
Gmail](</weblogs/archives/000533.html>), it is a bit of a worry. Anyone else
notice this?

>> p.s. This blog posting is a classic "cc: World" message. I want to ask
everyone who I might know who is using Gmail, but boy would it be annoying to
actually send an email to all of them!
