Recently I visited
[Curaçao](<http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=curacao+netherlands+antilles&ie=UTF8&ll=12.209838,-68.943329&spn=0.668425,1.043701&t=h&z=10&iwloc=addr&om=1>)
to participate in the celebration of the 275th anniversary of the building of
the Snoa. This is from an [article written by Sam D.
Gruber](<http://www.forward.com/articles/a-birthday-celebration-for-curacao-s-
historic-sy/>) (who I met there)

> "As evening fell in Willemstad in Curacao on April 16, scores of well-
> dressed people headed to the narrow Hanchi di Snoa, and into the courtyard
> of the Snoa — Curacao’s venerable synagogue built in 1732, home to
> Congregation Mikvé Israel-Emanuel, the oldest surviving synagogue in the
> Americas, and one where no Sabbath or major holiday has gone uncelebrated in
> 275 years."
