**Link: [Lago Blog - ORMs are criticized for the wrong reasons](https://www.getlago.com/blog/orms-are-criticized-for-the-wrong-reasons):** "ORMs, often criticized, are typically misused rather than inherently flawed. While they present challenges in visibility and performance, correct usage can mitigate these issues."
