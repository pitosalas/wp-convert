**Link: [Wordnik is a new online dictionary and more](None):** ""

Just came across [Wordnik](<http://www.wordnik.com>), what looks like a
[mega](<http://www.wordnik.com/words/mega>) dictionary. Maybe it's more of a
[meta](<http://www.wordnik.com/words/meta>) dictionary. It's part of the
[zeitgeist](<http://www.wordnik.com/words/zeitgeist>), don't you know? You
might [like](<http://www.wordnik.com/words/like>) it.
