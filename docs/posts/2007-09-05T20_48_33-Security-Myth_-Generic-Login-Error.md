Yay. This has been bothering me forever but I just didn't have the time to
blog about it. I totally agree.

While we are at it, the other annoyance is this. If a site requires my
password to have at least 6 characters with one numeral, please put that
little hint right under the password box. With all the different passwords I
have to enter in different places with different rules, it will save me a lot
of grief, and this one also does not add any security concern. After all, the
hacker could just request a new account and see what the password requirements
are.

Thanks Jay!.
