Ok there's not much to add to this story, except one angle. In my view, this
is good for Google. Say what? Microsoft is probably going to doll up (or ruin)
Skype with all kinds of Microsoft specific crap making it heavy and ugly if
you are not a Microsoftie.

Now you might argue that most of the world is a Microsoftie, and I assume you
are right. But I wonder whether that is true of the millions of Skype users.

I know for my own sick mind, Skype began losing it's luster as it made it's
Mac client bigger and uglier. That will only get worse. For my own sick mind,
again, I am now more attracted to Google Voice than I was before.

If my own sick mind represents a sizable group, this can actually end up
helping Google and hurting Microsoft.

Crazy?
