**" You may never go back to Internet Explorer again." **In the current
episode of Mossberg's Personal Technology, he sings the praises of tabbed
browsers. Of course old hat.

>>> "The Web browser is probably the most frequently used category of software
in the world. But in recent years, the browser most people rely on --
Microsoft's Internet Explorer -- has been stagnant, offering very few new
features."

>> He recommends Safari for Mac (of course,) and
[NetCaptor](<http://www.netcaptor.com/>) for Windows.

>> Of course in knocking Internet Explorer he neglects to say that both
NetCaptor and MyIE2 are relatively thin skins over the core IE ActiveX
controls. So much credit still goes to Microsoft. Sorry!

>> On Windows, I've found [MyIE2](<http://www.myie2.com>) somewhat better than
NetCaptor, but both are better than IE.
