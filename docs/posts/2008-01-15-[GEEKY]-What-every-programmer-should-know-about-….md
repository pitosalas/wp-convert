It's just the title of this post that caught my eye: "[What Every Programmer
Should Know About Memory, Part 1â€³:](<http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/>)

> "[snipâ€¦]The original document prints out at over 100 pages. We will be

I don't know about you, but it may be just a little bit more than I want to
