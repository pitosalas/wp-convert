>>> "One of the students, Jeremy Stribling, explains how they had developed a
computer program to generate random sequences of technobabble in order to
confirm their suspicions that papers of dubious academicity were bypassing
serious, or indeed, any scrutiny. In fact, the students claim ulterior,
financial motives behind this lack of proper peer review." ( **from** [Call

Gibberish?](<http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=325>))
