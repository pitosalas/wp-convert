Dave writes an enthousiastic review of this book: [The Secret in Building
26](<http://davedupre.com/2009/02/05/the-secret-in-building-26/>):

> "I just finished reading The Secret in Building 26: The Untold Story of How
> America Broke the Final U-boat Enigma Code. What a fascinating read! I’ve
> written before about the UK’s contribution to code breaking during WWII
> (‘Neglect’ of Bletchley condemned and Bletchley Park Update), but this is
> the first time I learned about some of the details of the US contribution. I
> always thought the majority, if not all, of the work was handled by the
> British, but this book details how it was much more of a partnership between
> the British and Americans. Most of this stuff is only recently declassified,
> and most is still classified. However, the information available is a great
> introduction to the dawn of the electronic computer." ( **from:** from [Big
