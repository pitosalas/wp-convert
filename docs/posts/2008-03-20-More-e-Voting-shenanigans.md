You know I follow the vagaries of computer voting machines, right? Here's an
interesting article about how one e-voting machine maker is trying to prohibit
a researcher from studying the security (= trying to hack into) one of their
machines:

> "Princeton Professor **Edward Felten** astonished Congress and increased
> doubts about electronic voting two years ago when he showed a House
> committee how easily he could open a Diebold touch-screen machine, insert
> new software and alter vote totals.
>
> Now, Sequoia Voting Systems, the other large voting-machine maker, has sent
> Felten an email suggesting legal action if he tries the same thing on its
> equipment." (from the [Wall Street
> Journal](<http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/03/18/voting-machine-maker-to-
> princeton-researcher-hands-off/>))
