# [Does Death Penalty Save Lives?](None)




Very interesting [article in the New York Times discussing whether the death
penalty saves lives](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/us/18deter.html>),

"According to roughly a dozen recent studies, executions save lives. For each
inmate put to death, the studies say, 3 to 18 murders are prevented.

The effect is most pronounced, according to some studies, in Texas and other
states that execute condemned inmates relatively often and relatively quickly.

> New York Times)

It seems to me that there's a key flaw in that study and analysis.

Let's say there's a correlation between the number of executions and the crime
rate. What if we randomly selected people to be executed in each district, no
matter whether they were guilty of a crime or not. Would that also deter crime
and 'save lives'? These studies imply that they would. It goes to the heart of
one of the key arguments against capital punishment, which is the equal
application of the law. (There are two additional really strong arguments
against it.)
