What are high reactives?

This is quite a long article which I won't attempt to summarize here. It
argues for an interesting explanation and clarification about why certain
people tend to react certain ways, differently to different kinds of stimulus.
This is from the conclusion:

> "An anxious temperament might serve a more exalted function too. “Our
> culture has this illusion that anxiety is toxic,” Kagan said. But without
> inner-directed people who prefer solitude, where would we get the writers
> and artists and scientists and computer programmers who make society hum?
> Kagan likes to point out that [T. S.
> Eliot](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/t_s_eliot/index.html?inline=nyt-
> per> "More articles about T.S. Eliot.") suffered from anxiety, and that
> biographies indicate that he was a typical high-reactive baby. “That line ‘I
> will show you fear in a handful of dust’ — he couldn’t have written that
> without feeling the tension and dysphoria he did,” Kagan said." (**from**
> [Understanding the Anxious
> Mind](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/magazine/04anxiety-t.html?em=&pagewanted=all>))

If this kind of stuff interest you, you might try tackling the whole article 🙂
