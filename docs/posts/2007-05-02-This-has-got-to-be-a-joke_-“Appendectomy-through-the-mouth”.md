> **David Pescovitz** : Physicians are now removing appendixes by entering the
> body through the mouth. The procedure, called Natural Orifice Translumenal
> Endosurgery (NOTES) involves the insertion of tools down the throat and
> through an incision in the stomach lining. Once the appendix is cut loose,
> it's pulled out of the mouth. Apparently, there are other variations of the
> technique, including gall bladder removal through an incision made in the
> vagina. One big benefit is that these surgeries don't leave any visible
> scar. Advocates say NOTES can be performed without putting the patient under
> because there are fewer nerves fibers within the body that transmit pain
> than on the skin. Recover time is also quicker
