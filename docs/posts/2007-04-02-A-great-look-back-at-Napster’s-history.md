Today we hear that [EMI is going to sell DRM-free music over the iTunes
Store](<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a4e12pnBnXzw&refer=home>).

how it reads. Here's an interesting look back at Napster who in a way started
it all. Check out [this

from [Don Dodge on The Next Big
Thing](<http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/>):
