I am a big fan of this book, so I was really surprised to find a freely
downloadable copy of the file in pdf form. I snooped around and the site seems
legit but it's odd that a very popular book is made available for zero
dollars.

Here's the link to [Lean Startup on
PdfBook.co.ke](<http://pdfbook.co.ke/details.php?title=The%20Lean%20Startup&author=Eric%20Ries&category=Business&eid=3117&type=Book>)

If you are wondering, .co.ke is Kenya. I posted a question to them to explain
whether this was above board. I wonder…
