I was surfing around preparing for my class and happened to look at [this page
on the Harvard Business School web site.](<http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurs/>)
The page is called " **Entrepreneurs** " and it says, among other things:

> "A video archive that captures insights from learning members of the
> School's entrepreneurial community. Entrepreneurs speak on a common set of
> themes including their development as entrepreneurs, strategies for
> identifying opportunity, and leadership. (from [Harvard Business
> School)](<http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurs/>)

Notice anything?

### Not a single female in the picture. (And only a single female on the whole
list, [Orit Gadiesh)](<http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurs/oritgadiesh.html>) I
got to thinking, there are lots of prominent female entrepreneurs. Are we to
conclude that for some reason HBS isn't generating them or that they were just
overlooked by whoever made this page?
