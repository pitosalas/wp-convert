A really [good article in the New York Times Magazine today about Lewis
Hyde](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/magazine/16hyde-t.html>). I had not
heard of [Lewis Hyde](<http://www.lewishyde.com>) before. First of all, the
article makes me want to pick up his book, [The
Gift:](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307279502/ref=s9sdps_c6_14_at1-rfc_g1-frt_p-3237_p_si2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=141BMCKH6EY0Q1Q8NVDB&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=463383351&pf_rd_i=507846>)

> "“The Gift,” the core argument of which depends on establishing an analogy
> between the making of art and how objects accrue value in traditional “gift
> economies,” has been praised as the most subtle, influential study of
> reciprocity since the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss’s 1924 essay of the
> same name." (from [What is Art
> For](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/magazine/16hyde-t.html>)?)

The article tries really hard to summarize Hyde's work and views but admits
that it's impossible. There are threads about open source, and creative
commons, and art, and copyright law, and the constitution, Thoreau, Emerson
and much more:

> "For Hyde, redressing the balance between private (corporate, individual)
> and common (public) interests depends not just on effective policy but also
> on recovering the idea of the cultural commons as a deeply American concept.
>
> To that end, he excavates a history of the American imagination in which the
> emphasis is not on the lone genius (Thoreau scribbling hermetically in the
> Massachusetts woods) but on the anonymous pamphleteer, the inventor eager to
> share his discoveries. In an essay that offers a preview of his book
> (posted, fittingly, on his Web site), Hyde posits that the history of the
> commons and of the creative self are, in fact, twin histories. “The citizen
> called into being by a republic of freehold farms,” he writes, “is close
> cousin to the writer who built himself that cabin at Walden Pond.
>
> But along with such mainstream icons goes a shadow tradition, the one that
> made Jefferson skeptical of patents, the one that made even Thoreau argue
> late in life that every ‘town should have … a primitive forest …, where a
> stick should never be cut for fuel, a common possession forever,’ the one
> that led the framers of the Constitution to balance ‘exclusive right’ with
> ‘limited times.’ It is a tradition worth recovering.” (from [What is Art
> For?)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/magazine/16hyde-t.html?pagewanted=2>)

Good stuff.
