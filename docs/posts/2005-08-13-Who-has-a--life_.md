>> As you might have seen over at our **[BlogBridge
blog](<http://www.blogbridge.com/>)** , we are experimenting with a new
visualization of blog postings, right inside BlogBridge. I've taken to calling
this the **Kleppner Widget** as it was invented by Paul and Andrew Kleppner
who have been contributing some cool stuff of late.

>> This is a snippet from a pre-release build of BlogBridge:

>>

>> What you are looking at is a display of 4 Feeds ([Dan
Gillmor](<http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor>), [Joho the
Blog,](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/>) [Emergence
Marketiong](<http://www.emergencemarketing.com/>) and [Pito's Blog](</>)) All
the way over to the right you can see the visualization.

>>

>> Here's how you read it: From left to right, **each column is 1** day,
starting today, yesterday, and back to 1 week ago. The number of dots in the
column corresponds to the number of new articles or posts on that day.

>>

>> Hey look at that: [David](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/>) and
[Dan](<http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor>) are posting like crazy,
[Francois](<http://www.emergencemarketing.com/>) pretty good, and I am the
laggard.

>>

>> We aren't sure yet whether this new visualization is the cats pajamas or
too gimicky but we are quite fond of it. It will probably make it in the very
first weekly release after BlogBridge 2.0 ships early next week.

>>

>> What do you think? Too much information, or a nice compact summary of how
active a blog is? And by the way, should the days run left to right (as they
do today) or right to left?
