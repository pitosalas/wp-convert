This does not compute:

According to our pal Ryan Seacrest, over 45 million votes were cast for this
week's vote-off. Can anyone explain the discrepancy? First of all I really
doubt that the majority of viewers vote at all. My guess would be that at most
one in 4 vote. Which would imply that each one voted an average of 7+ times.
