From TimesOnline, a good reminder to not forget that we do live in a USA
bubble sometimes, and don't pay enough attention to the rest of the world:

"A little over two decades later, Arkady Volozh is the chief executive and one
of the founders of [Yandex](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex>), Russia’s
most popular internet search engine, a company now valued at £2.5 billion.
Widely described as Russia’s answer to Google, Yandex was launched only eight
years ago but is now visited by 8m people a day. More impressive still, Yandex
and Volozh are credited with humbling Google, by denting its global
domination." (from "Russians dent Google's world domination")

Hmm, let me try the [query that tripped up Cuil:](</2008/07/28/cuil-vs-
google/>)

[ipod cradle wireless
sync](<http://yandex.ru/yandsearch?text=ipod+cradle+wireless+sync>)

Whoops. The site is all Russian. But interestingly I typed in the query in
english and I seem to have gotten fairly good results. [Certainly better than
I got from Cuil](<http://www.cuil.com/search?q=ipod+cradle+wireless+sync>).
And the oddest phenomenon is now when [I write that search in
googl](<http://www.google.com/search?q=ipod+cradle+wireless+sync&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a>)e, it takes me to [my own post on that very
topic. ](</2008/07/28/cuil-vs-google/>)

Can you spell "echo chamber?"


[Heard of Yandex?](None)
