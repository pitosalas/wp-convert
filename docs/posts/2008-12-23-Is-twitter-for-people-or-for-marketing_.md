As you may have noticed, I am using [Twitter](<http://www.twitter.com>) a
little more often now. As much as anything it is to learn more about what it's
like, because we are working on full Twitter support in
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>), which should be cool. The question
is, what should it look like? Anyway, more on that on the [BlogBridge
blog](<http://www.blogbridge.com>).

For now, here are some interesting pointers I have come across that you might
find enlightening:
