Ask The Pilot is a regular Salon column. Recently there was a good one,
essentially about [how hard or easy it is to fly and land a

> "But wait, he goes on. "Most of the time," says heyja, "pilots will push the
> seats back, push a button, never look out the window, arranging their
> Jeppsens [sic], drink their coffee, whine about the Democrats and their
> disappearing pensions." (from [Ask The
> Pilot](<http://www.salon.com/tech/col/smith/2008/11/14/askthepilot298/index.html>))

to which he retorts:

> "Compare, for a moment, an airline flight with a medical procedure. That's
> as good an analogy as any, I think. I propose that in order to deliver an
> airplane safely to its destination, the knowledge and expertise required of

> safely perform an operation. Doctors and pilots both reap the benefits of
> advanced technology. It makes their jobs easier. Albeit not easy, and in no
> way does it diminish the requisite skill, knowledge, experience and
> responsibility." (from [Ask the
> Pilot](<http://www.salon.com/tech/col/smith/2008/11/14/askthepilot298/index.html>))
