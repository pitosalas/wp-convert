A random, highly specific and geeky tip:

> If you’ve used Capistrano before, you’re familiar with the large error logs.
> Finding errors is, well, a hassle. You’ve got a whole slew of text, some
> just saying what command it’s going to execute next, sometimes errors,
> sometimes just output from Bundler or whatever it’s running. (from [Rails
> Tip #8: Capistrano Colors](<http://excid3.com/blog/rails-tip-8-capistrano-
> colors/>))

Just follow the link to [Rails Tip #8: Capistrano
Colors](<http://excid3.com/blog/rails-tip-8-capistrano-colors/>)) and your Cap
life will be a little better.
