# [It’s easy to predict the future!](None)



>>

>> **It 's easy to predict the future. **Tim Bray has just concluded an
interesting series of postings on what he calls [TPSM or Technology Predictor
Success Matrix.](<http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/03/TPM1>)
I've had a [belief for a while](<//2003/10/04.html>) that actually it's easier
than you think to predict the future of technologies. I will limit my comments
to technology and computer related predictions, but I bet this applies to
other fields as well. ****

>> **Want to see?** I predict that in the future:

>>

>>   * Computers will be able to recognize handwriting

>>   * Computers will be able to understand human spoken language

>>   * There will be pervasive, high bandwidth, wireless connectivity

>>

>>

>> And let me try some non computer predictions. I predict that in the future:

>>

>>   * Personal aircraft will be a common mode of commuting

>>   * Self-piloting and automated terrestial vehicles (cars) will be
commonplace

>>   * There will be a cure for cancer

>>

>>

>> **Ok, enough nonsense.**

>>

>> My point is predicting what will happen eventually _**is easy …**_ What's
hard of course is to predict _**when.**_

>>

>> So the first question to try to pin down a prognosticator is _When?_
**Without that, the prediction is more or less useless.** What do you think?
