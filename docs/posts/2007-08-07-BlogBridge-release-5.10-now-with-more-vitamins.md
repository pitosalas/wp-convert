Over on BlogBridge we just announced that [release 5.10 just came
out](<http://www.blogbridge.com/2007/08/06/blogbridge-510-announced/>), you
should [try BlogBridge
out](<http://www.blogbridge.com/downloads/blogbridge/>)! In the post there is
also a review and explanation of the difference between our bi-weekly
development releases and our full-fledged stable releases which come out every
6 or so months. Here is an exhaustive list of [new stuff in
BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com/category/history-of-changes/>) over the
releases.

Of special note is the neat [new and improved photo album
view](<http://www.blogbridge.com/2007/08/03/blogbridge-photo-album-view-even-
cooler/>) which brings the fun and pleasure of following photo blogs to a new
level. At least I think so! Check it out, tell your friends, digg it, stumble
it, and in general, help us get the word out!
