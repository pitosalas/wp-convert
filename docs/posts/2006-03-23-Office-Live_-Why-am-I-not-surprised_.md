>> Have you heard how Microsoft is shipping Windows **Live** and Office
**Live** and **this-live** and **that-live**? I've seen this **movie** before
and I have to say that I am skeptical. A competitor starts getting successful
with a line that Microsoft doesn't own and out comes the ** "me-too-FUD"**
based on smoke and mirrors.

>> After all, Office has had ActiveX controls **forever** , and I would just
not be too surprised if Office Live is just a re- **assembly** of some cool
parts that they had **lying around** with a really great marketing push. Color
me skeptical. Or cynical.

>>> "The power of Microsoft's branding is so great that **slapping** the
labels 'Live' and 'Office' on a piecemeal bundle of rehashed services seems to
have the whole world agog. The **evidence doesn 't** justify the excitement."
( **from**[ "Whatever Office Live is, it ain't the Web
Office](<http://www.activewin.com/awin/comments.asp?HeadlineIndex=33627>)")
