Just one phrase that jumped out of the [new missive from Zuck about
privacy:](<http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150378701937131>)

> "As a matter of fact, privacy is so deeply embedded in all of the
> development we do that every day **tens of thousands of servers worth of
> computational resources are consumed** checking to make sure that on any
> webpage we serve, that you have access to see each of the sometimes hundreds
> or even thousands of individual pieces of information that come together to
> form a Facebook page." (**from**[ Our Commitment to the Facebook
> Community](<http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150378701937131>))

When I tell (non computer) people that it takes hundreds or thousands of
servers in hundreds of data centers to run something like Google or Facebook
**they are surprised.**

Even**I am surprised** at "tens of thousands of servers worth of computational
resources."

**Wait** , why the nuanced phrasing? What is a server's worth of computational
resource? Is that a server or something else? **Wait** , what's a server
anyway? Oh well. **Parsing**.
