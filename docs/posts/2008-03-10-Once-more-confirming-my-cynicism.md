Sorry, but for some reason it seems that the
[cynics](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism>) win out once more:

> "I have acted in a way that violates my obligation to my family and  
> violates my or any sense of right or wrong,” said Mr. Spitzer…" (from **[The
> New York Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/10/nyregion/10cnd-
> spitzer.html?hp>)**)
