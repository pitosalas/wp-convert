I just came across [Dave Dupre's blog](<http://davedupre.com>). Some good
reading there, for example:

> "[â€¦snip] If the single test does not show a huge improvement, the project is
> considered a failure and scrapped. This happens all the time, and it always
> stifles innovation. Why propose something new if you have to be right all
> the time?
>
> Innovation does not proceed on a schedule. To maintain a culture of
> innovation, occasional failure must be allowed - even encouraged! As long as
> you learn from your mistakes and move on and get better, the team and the
> company will be better off." (from [Fear of
> Failure](<http://davedupre.com/2007/05/07/fear-of-failure/>))
