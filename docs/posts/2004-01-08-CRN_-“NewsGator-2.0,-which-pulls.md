>>> "Also on Wednesday, NewsGator Technologies announced version 2.0 of its
NewsGator news aggregator at CES. NewsGator 2.0, which pulls news feeds in RSS
or Atom syndication formats from sources such as online news Web sites, blogs,
and newsgroups, now lets users synchronize their news collection efforts on
multiple machines, such as their in-the-office desktop and their on-the-road
laptop. The new edition also offers an application programming interface (API)
that corporate developers can use to build customized news apps for employees.
NewsGator 2.0, which collects news feeds and then displays them within
Microsoft Outlook 2000 and later, will ship Jan. 19, and cost $29 per user."
