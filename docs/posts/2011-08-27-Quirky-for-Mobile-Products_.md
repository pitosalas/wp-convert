I read about [Quirky.com](<http://www.quirky.com/>) in the [paper the other
day.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/garden/ben-kaufman-quirkycom-founder-
on-problem-solving-qa.html>) From my perusal it's a site where people (you and
me) can submit ideas for manufactured products.

For example, let's say I have an idea for a dog leash with a built in
flashlight. Clever eh? Well, you can describe it to the best of your ability
and submit it to the Quirky.com site.

Ideas are socially curated (translation: visitors to the site can vote on how
much they like the product.) Once they reach a certain threshold then the
Quirky staff analyzes the idea from a design, marketing, manufacturing
perspective, and decides whether it's worth pursuing. If it is, they actually
design or mock it up and put it up for "pre-sale" in their catalog. If enough
people buy it then the product is actually created and you (the inventor) gets
a small cut of the profits. [Here's their diagram of the
process](<http://www.quirky.com/learn>).

What if we created a similar service, but focused exclusively on products for
app phones (e.g. iPhone and Android.) What do you think?
