**Link: [Building a Rails CI pipeline with GitHub Actions](https://boringrails.com/articles/building-a-rails-ci-pipeline-with-github-actions/):** "GitHub Actions is an automation platform that you run directly from inside a repository. We can use it as a testing CI/CD pipeline and keep everything close to the code."
