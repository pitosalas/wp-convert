If you haven't heard about Podcasting (what, are you living under a rock?) the
New York Times has a good introduction:

>>

>>> "Their show, mostly ad-libbed, is a podcast, a kind of recording that,
thanks to a technology barely six months old, anyone can make on a computer
and then post to a Web site, where it can be downloaded to an iPod or any MP3
player to be played at the listener's leisure."
