Goolrick](<http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/266461.Robert_Goolrick>)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](<http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/211415270>)

Odd book. In the end I really liked it but at first it takes a surprising set
of turns and is not at all what you would think. The writing style is almost
poetic which is what I think I enjoyed the most,
