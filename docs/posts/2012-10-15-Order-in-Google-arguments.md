Does Google give a different answer if you reorder the words in the search?
What? A trivial question? Have you ever tried to refine a search by reordering
the words? Wouldn't it be useful if you knew for sure that it would or would
not make a difference?

Experiment:

    
    
    ruby rails bureaucrat gem examples
    
    
    rails bureaucrat gem examples ruby

These two searches indeed did produce different results! And not just a
reordering of the results. There were at least two results in the top 7 which
were present in one and not the other.

Q.E.D.
