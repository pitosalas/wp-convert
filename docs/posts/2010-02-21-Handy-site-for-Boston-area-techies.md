I came across [VentureFizz](<http://venturefizz.com/>). It's a broad resource
for Boston area techies: "[VentureFizz can help you see what's buzzing in
Boston's tech community](<http://venturefizz.com/>)" Particularly useful is
their [Event's calendar](<http://venturefizz.com/events>), which as far as I
can see is one of the better ones. An analogous site is [Greenhorn
Connect](<http://www.greenhornconnect.com/>), which is trying to achieve
something similar but seems more focused on up and coming entrepreneurs.
