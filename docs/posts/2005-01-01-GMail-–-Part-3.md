Continuing thinking about GMail and what Google really is up to. From the
_Department of Unintended Consequences_(**via Paul Kleppner**):

>>

>>> … somebody has created a Windows file system extension so that you can use
your 1gb GMail account as a remote file system!  
> It's a crazy hack. But it makes me think that something like this could
> easily be done as a true service by Google (with sensible protocols).

>> [Check out the Gmail Virtual File system
hack.](<http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm>) Pretty neat. My guess is Google
loves this kind of thing, and at the point when it starts being a noticable
stress on their system (never) they will either start offering it themselves
(with ads) or prohibit it. Love them unintended consequences! **p.s. Happy
2005!**
