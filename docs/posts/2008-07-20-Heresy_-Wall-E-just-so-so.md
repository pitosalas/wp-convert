Yeah I know all the [reviews have been
raving](<http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wall_e/>) - "Best movie this year" -
"[Will change your
life](<http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/07/21/080721crci_cinema_denby>)"
- and so on. I saw this new animated film last night. It did have really
wonderful "Star Wars"-class visuals but as an overall story and movie
experience, well, it was fine. Not even as good as Toy Story. Sorry.
