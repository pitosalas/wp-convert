Just check out this well argued, detailed piece, "[Wake up to the dangers of a
deepening crisis", by Lawrence
Summers](<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b56079a8-9b71-11dc-8aad-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=95e85a0c-68fd-11db-b4c2-0000779e2340,print=yes.html>):

> "Three months ago it was reasonable to expect that the subprime credit

> Even if necessary changes in policy are implemented, the odds now favour a

This gloom and doom view is echoed by much of the commentary I've come across
over the last month, for example, this from today's New York Times,
["Innovating Our Way to Financial Crisis":
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?ref=opinion>)

> "The bottom line is that policy makers left the financial industry free to
> innovate â€” and what it did was to innovate itself, and the rest of us, into
> a big, nasty mess." (from [Paul Krugman in the New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?ref=opinion>).)

You be the judge. I'm calling my broker ðŸ™‚
