This is pretty mundane, but if you happen to be looking for a lamp, [this is
the most comprehensive](<http://www.lampsplus.com/>) collection that I've seen
on the web, on a nice site, and with reasonable prices too! It's called [LAMPS
PLUS](<http://www.lampsplus.com/>). And I don't mean
[L.A.M.P](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29>), I really
mean, [just lamps](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamp>) 🙂 Technorati Tags:
