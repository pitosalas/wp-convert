I am a LifeLock customer and so I follow developments in this arena pretty
closely. Check this post [LifeLock and Identity
Theft](<http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/06/lifelock_and_id.html>)
from [Schneier on Security](<http://www.schneier.com/blog/index.rdf>):

All in all, I probably will remain a customer. Schneier does a good job
basically saying that LifeLock is clever and useful but too expensive. That's
more positive than the press they've been getting.
