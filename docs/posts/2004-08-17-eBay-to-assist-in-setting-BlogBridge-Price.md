So, some day we will consider [BlogBridge
](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)complete enough to actually be worth a few
bucks. But the question is, how much? I've said many times, that even if
**every single cool idea** I have is perfectly realized that the **most** one
could expect is maybe $20 or $30 per copy. But even that is a lot.

>> So, here's a thought. **Let the market decide**.

>>

>> What we plan to do is to **offer a limited number**(say 10) of perpetual
BlogBridge licenses on **eBay** with an opening bid of $1 and no reserve. And
**see what happens**. Depending on how it goes we could offer twice that
number of licenses an opening bid equal to the average price the first batch
went for. And so on.

>>

>> **Cool idea** , eh?

>>

>> By the way, [David Coursey's recent Blog entry
](<http://blog.ziffdavis.com/coursey/archive/2004/08/16/1733.aspx>)is titled:
"Marketplace to gets to set MS Prices" When I saw that I thought David **had
to be writing about this idea** , but upon more reflection anyone would
realize that this is something that MS would never do!

>>

>> In fact this idea is **inspired** by what Sun did recently, which was [to
use eBay to determine the right price for their hardware/software developer
package](<http://members.ebay.com/ws2/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&userid=auctions.sun.com>),
which I thought **was a pretty cool idea**. Credit where credit is due.
