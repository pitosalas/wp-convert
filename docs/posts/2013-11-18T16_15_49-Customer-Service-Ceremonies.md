Nowadays, when I am done talking to telephone suport of any company, they seem
to be trained to go through a long ceremony before letting me go:

me: "Thanks, I am all set"

They: "Did I solve all your problems"?

me: "Yes, thanks"

They: "Ok then thanks for calling XXXX"

me: "You're welcome"

They: "Thanks and have a good day"

me: "Thanks"

Question: is it impolite for me to hang up before this whole ceremony is
complete? Say "Yes, Thanks" and then hang up? Or am I being a rude, impatient,
always in a hurry northeasterner?
