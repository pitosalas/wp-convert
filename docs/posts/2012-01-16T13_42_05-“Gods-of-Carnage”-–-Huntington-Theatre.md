I Just came back from seeing "[Gods Of
Carnage"](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=10226&src=t>)
at the [Huntington Theatre (in
Boston)](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/index2.aspx>) tonight. Couldn't
wait to post my recommendation.

It's short (about 80 minutes - no intermission), fast paced, well acted and
funny. It's a story about two couples who are thrown together to discuss a
playground altercation between their two sons. That's the set up.

The story takes up an evening when they get together to discuss it. Huntington
has been embracing the web and social media in excellent fashion of late. I
just noticed the ingenious new bit, which is doing a "trailer" for a theatre
performance. I had not seen that before:

By the way, this has been a **great season** for the **Huntington**. We've
been going there for years and enjoy it although each season there are some
better and some worse.

Between Gods of Carnage (this play) and
[Captors](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=10179>)
from earlier this season we already have two outstanding - two thumbs up -
plays and the season isn't even half over yet.

I am **excited** to see what comes next!
