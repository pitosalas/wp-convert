>> One of the cool things about BlogBridge's (free) companion service, is that
keeps track for you what you have and have not read, _even if you are using
BlogBridge on more than one computer!_

>>

>> In other words, please sign up for the service, and set your
synchronization options the way you want them (daily, each time you run
BlogBridge, or manually.) Each time you synchronize, not only will your
subscription lists be kept in synch, but also which articles you have or have
not read.

>>

>> **_Important note on new BlogBridge 1.5._** __ For those of you who are
running our 'weekly' release of BlogBridge, you are now experiencing a faster,
smaller architecture. One of the known consequences of this is that when
upgrading to 1.5 from a previous version in many cases articles unread state
may be lost. Don't worry, this is a once only, known occurrence! Thank you for
your patience!
