Check out this [insightful editorial in Sunday's New York by Frank
Rich](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16rich.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1>).
I thought it was really good. Here's an excerpt:

> "“It’s the economy, the facts that millions of people have lost their jobs

Can you imagine better free publicity for [Mad
Men](<http://blogs.amctv.com/mad-men/2009/08/talk-forum-081409.php>)? As a
result, I eagerly awaited to see the season opener of [Mad
Men](<http://blogs.amctv.com/mad-men/2009/08/talk-forum-081409.php>) last
night. It was disappointingly rudderless. **What a missed opportunity**.
Instead of getting their hooks into a potentially new audience, nothing much
happened. Yes it had the usual great acting and interesting vignettes. But
nothing that would make it **must see tv** , although I still am putting it on
my Tivo 🙂
