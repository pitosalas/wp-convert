# [Loomio: Collaborative Decision Making](None)




[Loomio](<https://www.loomio.org>) is a new app looks quite cool and worth
checking out:

> "Loomio is a collaborative decision-making tool. Loomio reduces the cost of
> participation in decision-making, making it easy for any group to translate
> online communication into real-world collective action….Creating a world
> where it’s easy for anyone to participate in decisions that affect them.
> With the right collaborative process, groups generate better ideas,
> decisions and actions than any individual would by themselves. Loomio breaks
> down the barriers to participation in decision-making at every level: in
> neighbourhoods, community organisations, businesses, social movements, and
> local and national governance.Collaborative decision-making balances
> individual autonomy with the collective good." ( **from**
