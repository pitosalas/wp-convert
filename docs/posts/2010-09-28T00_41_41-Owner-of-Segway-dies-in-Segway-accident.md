This is just a weird weird happening:

> "His body was found late Sunday morning after a passer-by reported seeing a
> man plummet 30 feet into the River Wharfe, the police said, adding that a
> “Segway-style vehicle” had also been found.
>
> They did not say what had caused the accident." ( **from** [New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/technology/28segway.html?_r=2&hpw>))
