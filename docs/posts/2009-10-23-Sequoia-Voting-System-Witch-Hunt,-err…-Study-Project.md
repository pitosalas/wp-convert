There's been (among election geeks, anyway) a flurry of comment on the
discovery (by accident) that Sequoia uses SQL Stored Procedures. First of all
the code snippet that was released was IMGHO innoccuous, second, I don't think
it's really clear where that code snippet is from. So I agree with this post
(and his vigorous defense in the comment stream) framing this as a Witch Hunt.
