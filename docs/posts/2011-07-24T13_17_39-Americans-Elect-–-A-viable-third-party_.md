It's unusual to see [Thomas
Friedman](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/thomaslfriedman/index.html?inline=nyt-
per>) to throw his weight this thoroughly behind an outside organization:

> "The goal of [Americans Elect](<http://www.americanselect.org/>) is to take
> a presidential nominating process now monopolized by the Republican and
> Democratic parties, which are beholden to their special interests, and blow
> it wide open -- guaranteeing that a credible third choice, nominated
> independently, will not only be on the ballot in every state but be able to
> take part in every presidential debate and challenge both parties from the
> middle with the best ideas on how deal with the debt, education and jobs."
> (from The [New York
> TImes](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/opinion/sunday/24friedman.html?_r=1>))

I am not sure this is for real, but it sure sounds interesting. I am [signing
