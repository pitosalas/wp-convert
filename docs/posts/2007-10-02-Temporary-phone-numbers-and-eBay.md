When you are selling or buying something on the web, say eBay or Craigslist,
it always is a question whether to give your 'real' phone number out. I just
came across Numbr.com (credit
[Lifehacker](<http://lifehacker.com/software/privacy/get-a-free-disposable-
phone-number-with-numbr-270222.php>), and several others) which appears to
have a neat solution to this.

Simply, it gets you (for free, but doesn't everything have to be free
nowadays?) a temporary phone number which will anonymously forward calls to
your real number. Simple and useful. Check out
