tonight I squirted a few shots of Sriracha on my multi-layered-grilled-
vegetable [parmigiana](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiana>). And now
there's an article about Sriracha in Business Week!

"…Like ketchup, sriracha is a generic term, its name coming from a port town
in Thailand where the sauce supposedly was conceived. When people in America
talk about sriracha, what they’re really talking about is Huy Fong’s version.
It’s been name-checked on The Simpsons, is featured prominently on the Food
Network, and has inspired a cottage industry of knockoffs, small-batch
artisanal homages, and merchandise ranging from iPhone cases to air fresheners
to lip balm to sriracha-patterned high heels… " (

Just writing this blog post is making my mouth water! And, yeah, so I also
learned that I had been pronouncing it wrong the whole time. It's

Sriracha
