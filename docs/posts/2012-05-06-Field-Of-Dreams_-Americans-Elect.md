Americans Elect got Tom Friedman to endorse their effort to get a third party
presidential ballot in November. He wrote about it and convinced me too that
it was a good idea. A month or two ago I started having misgivings and now, it
seems like things are really turning sour for Americans Elect.

An [article in Techpresident.Com ](<http://techpresident.com/news/22148/op-ed-
americans-elect-they-built-it-and-nobody-came#.T6Pvbfdd82E.twitter>)paints a
pretty bleak picture:

> "Americans Elect is the best example of the Field of Dreams Fallacy I have
> ever observed. The organization spent a reported $9 million building a
> cutting edge platform, assuming that high-priced technology and a mainstream
> media blitz would result in a centrist groundswell that revolutionizes
> American politics. It built no participatory community, and assumed that the
> Internet would magically serve one up for them. The result has been an all-
> too-predictable failure." ( **from**

Maybe we didn't understand the dynamics of the web well enough:

> "Maybe, just maybe, this was prove a high-enough profile blunder that we'll
> learn something from it about the limits of online politics from it.
>
> The lowered transaction costs of the web help to reveal the true demand
> curve for citizen politics. That can prove transformative -- particularly
> around issues where there's pent-up demand, but traditionally high barriers
> to participation." ( **from**

But that didn't happen:

> "That's not the case with voting, however. The barriers to voting aren't
> very high. People don't follow politics because they don't like politics.
> For issues where no one was particularly motivated, and barriers were
> already pretty low, the new media environment doesn't change outcomes.
>
> There is no radical center in American politics. Build the nicest platform
> money can buy for a disinterested population and you're still going to be
> left hearing the chirp of online crickets." ( **from**
