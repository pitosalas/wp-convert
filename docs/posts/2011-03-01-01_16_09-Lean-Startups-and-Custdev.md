I had the interesting experience this weekend to attend the "[Lean Startup
Machine" weekend at the Microsoft
NERD.](<http://boston.theleanstartupmachine.com/>) It was kind of a hackathon
for Lean Startups, which are startups that practice something refererred to as
Customer Development, or
[CustDev](<http://www.foundora.com/2010/11/09/patrick-vlaskovits-co-author-of-
entrepreneurs-guide-to-custdev-explains-custdev-lean-startup/>). If you've not
heard about it, here's a [40 minute lecture about CustDev
](<http://www.vimeo.com/7345172>)by one of the top gurus, Eric Ries. Another
reference would be essentially the founding document:, "[The Four Steps to the
Epiphany"?](<http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steven-
Blank/dp/0976470705>)

The high level story is this: we have well defined and articulated
methodologies for managing the creation of software: Agile, Extreme
Programming, etc. But on the other hand, there are no equivalent 'scientific'
methodologies for defining products and understanding market.

Another pithy statement: Startups fail, not because they fail to create the
product that they envisioned, but, because customers don't want the product
that got built.

The methodology has it's [rabid fans](<http://groups.google.com/group/lean-
startup-circle?pli=1>). However you feel about it, you owe it to yourself to
[learn more about it.](<http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/>)

As I digest what I learned, I will be posting more, as well as links to a
bunch of interesting tools we learned about.
