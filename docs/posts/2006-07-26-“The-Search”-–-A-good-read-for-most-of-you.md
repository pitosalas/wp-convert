>> If you read my blog chances are you'll **really enjoy** John Batelle's book
[The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and
Transformed Our
Culture](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/1591840880&tag=blogbridge-20&camp=1789&creative=9325>)![](http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1591840880). Actually it's
**mostly about Google** , but in a bit of clever marketing I think the broader
title makes it more attractive. Many people have reviewed it so I won't bother
other than to say that it's a really good read and worthwhile.
**Recommended**.
