>> If you work with software developers you'll **appreciate** these two pieces
by **Paul Graham** , author of [Hackers and
Painters](<http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html>), a book that I also
**recommend** heartily.

>>

>> He always has **interesting** things to say:

>>

>>> "I once claimed that nerds were unpopular in secondary school mainly
because they had better things to do than work full-time at being popular.
Some said I was just telling people what they wanted to hear. Well, I'm now
about to do that in a spectacular way: I think **undergraduates are
undervalued**." (From "[Hiring is
obsolete](<http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html>)")

>>

>> I also came across this [really excellent IT Conversations
Podcast](<http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail188.html>) of a speech he
gave at the Open Source Convention (OSCON), which I also highly recommend (and
it would be a good introduction to [IT
Conversations](<http://www.itconversations.com/index.html>) and Podcasting if
you were **looking for an excuse** ðŸ™‚
