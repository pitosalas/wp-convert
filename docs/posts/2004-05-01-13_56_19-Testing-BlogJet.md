>> I have installed an interesting application -
[BlogJet](<http://blogjet.com/>). It's a cool Windows client for my blog tool
(as well as for other tools). Get your copy here:

>> And here's the clever thing: the preceding two paragraphs are automatically
offered to me when I install BlogJet, which encourages me to try it, and at
the same time, advertise it. In fact, I found out about BlogJet [when I saw
this
post](<http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/04/testing_blogjet.html>).
Very clever. I think I am going to like this utility! (And this last paragraph
was indeed written by me, myselfâ€¦)
