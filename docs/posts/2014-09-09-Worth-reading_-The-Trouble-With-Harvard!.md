# [Worth reading: The Trouble With Harvard!](None)




The most-read article in the history of [The New Republic] is not about war,
politics, or great works of art. It’s about the admissions policies of a
handful of elite universities, most prominently my employer, Harvard, which is
figuratively and literally immolated on the cover.

It’s not surprising that William Deresiewicz’s “[Don’t Send Your Kid to the
Ivy League](<http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118747/ivy-league-schools-are-
overrated-send-your-kids-elsewhere>)” has touched a nerve. Admission to the
Ivies is increasingly seen as the bottleneck to a pipeline that feeds a
trickle of young adults into the remaining lucrative sectors of our
financialized, winner-take-all economy. And their capricious and opaque
criteria have set off an arms race of credential mongering that is
immiserating the teenagers and parents (in practice, mostly mothers) of the
upper middle class.
