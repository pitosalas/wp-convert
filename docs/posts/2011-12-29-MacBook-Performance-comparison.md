Due to an unusual set of coincidences I have 3 different Macintosh computers
in my office today so I could run performance comparisons. After a brief bit
of research I came across [XBench](<http://xbench.com/>), a free, open source
benchmarking suite. I am not positive that it is the state of the art, but
it's quite popular. Here's what I found:

**Mac Pro, Early 2009, with 6 Gig of memory and a Solid State Disk (SDD)
(MacPro4,1)**

  * Overall: 234.09, CPU: 198.42
  * Memory: 474.51
  * Graphics: 379.61

**MacBook Air, Late 2010, with 4 Gig of memory and a SDD (MacBookAir3,2)**

  * Overall: 126.07
  * CPU: 149.17
  * Memory: 198.90
  * Graphics: 159.94

**Macbook Air, Late 2011, with 4 Gig of memory and a SDD (MacBookAir4,2)**

  * Overall: 199.85
  * CPU: 205.25
  * Memory: 508.89
  * Graphics: 316.38

I know, you want to know the units, and I don't know them. But still you can
see remarkably that the brand new MacBook Air is almost as performant as the
huge towering Mac Pro, Pretty amazing and telling.
