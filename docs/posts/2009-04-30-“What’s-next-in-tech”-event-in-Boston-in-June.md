If you live in the Boston area and somehow connected to technology professions
you should be interested in this meeting being put on in June:

**[What's Next In Tech - Where will the next waves of growth will come
from?](<http://whatsnext.eventbrite.com/>)**

> Date: Thursday, June 25th  
> Time: 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM (ET)  
> Where: Boston University, School of Management, 595 Commonwealth Ave,
> Boston, 02215  
> Price: [$40](<http://whatsnext.eventbrite.com/>)

(If you are a student interested in attending this event and would like
financial assistance, **scholarships are available** through
www.stayinma.com.)

Take a look at the program, [Scott Kirsner of the Boston
Globe](<http://www.innoeco.com/>) has lined up an **impressive** slate of
speakers, both successful entrepreneurs as well as folks from the VC
community. There will be discussion about mobile software, videogames,
robotics, social media, cleantech, cloud computing, all potential major growth
areas for us in New England.

I've been very **deeply involved** lately in what you might broadly call
[government transparency](<http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/>). Specifically
my work is in [next generation voting](<http://www.osdv.org/>) (as in
democracy) technology. With what's going on in the economy, and what seems to
be the commitment from the current president, I suspect that too will be a
growth area. Yes, a lot of the work going on now is **non-profit/foundation**
driven but I say it's a **growth business** , just like enterprise software
was a few years ago. I hope there's discussion of that too at this cool event.

If you are a Boston area entrepreneur, techie, student with a big idea, **or
all of the above** , you should definitely **[come to this
event](<http://whatsnext.eventbrite.com/>).**
