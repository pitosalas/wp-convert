[This is actually a pretty cool
idea](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2009/09/dear_general_mills_why_not_put.html>)!
Here's a quote from Scott's post:

> "I'd like to see a Wheaties box featuring Sally Ride, the first American
> woman in space (who also happened to be an astrophysicist and Stanford PhD);
> Internet pioneers Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf; the great primatologist
> Jane Goodall…" ( **from:**[Dear General
> Mills](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2009/09/dear_general_mills_why_not_put.html>))
