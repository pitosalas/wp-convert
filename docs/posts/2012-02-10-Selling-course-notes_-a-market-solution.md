**Link: [Selling course notes: a market solution](None):** ""

Should it be ok for students to **take notes** during a class and turn them
into a marketable product that they **make money on**?

If I am teaching the same class again this year, students could buy the course
notes and potentially do better, or learn more. That's a good thing, right?

However is it fair to me? After all these students are becoming multi-
millionaires by reselling my work, my intellectual property. **Yeah right.**

One professor has an **amusing solution** to this dilemma, but I think it
still misses the point;
