â€“Several million people employ electronic mail for some significant portion of
their professional communications. Yet in my experience few people have
figured out how to use the net productively. A great deal of effort is going
into technical means for finding information on the net, but hardly anybody
has been helping newcomers figure out where the net fits in the larger picture
of their own careers. These notes are a first attempt to fill that gap,
building on the most successful practices I've observed in my twenty years on
the net. I will focus on the use of electronic communication in research
communities, but the underlying principles will be applicable to many other
communities as well.
