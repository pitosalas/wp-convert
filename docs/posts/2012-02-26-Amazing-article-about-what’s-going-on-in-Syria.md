In the Sunday Times (of London, I gather, but they don't feel the need to
include that in their name) I saw this outstanding article about what's going
on in Syria. (No I don't regularly read the Sunday Times, I got this through a
link.

Here's a little from the article by Marie Colvin:

> "Our house was hit by a rocket so 17 of us were staying in one room,” she
> recalls as Mimi, her three-year-old daughter, and Mohamed, her five-year-old
> son, cling to her abaya.
>
> “We had had nothing but sugar and water for two days and my husband went to
> try to find food.” It was the last time she saw Maziad, 30, who had worked
> in a mobile phone repair shop. “He was torn to pieces by a mortar shell.”
>
> For Noor, it was a double tragedy. Adnan, her 27-year-old brother, was
> killed at Maziad’s side. "(from [The Sunday
> Times)](<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/news/article874796.ece>)

The sad postscript is that this article was [Marie Colvin's
](<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/MarieColvin/>)last, as she was
herself killed soon after in a bombing.
