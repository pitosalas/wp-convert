Hey Stern fans, can you believe what kind of a day it was today? What a soap
opera, but riveting.

I heard it in bits and pieces as I was driving between meetings today, and I
was waiting either for Artie to quit or for Howard to fire him.

And then [I read now on the Stern web site that indeed Artie says he is
leaving the show in January.](<http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs>)

> "Artie would end up leaving the showâ€¦Artie agreed with him. When

> January."

As I say, a soap opera for sure, but riveting.
