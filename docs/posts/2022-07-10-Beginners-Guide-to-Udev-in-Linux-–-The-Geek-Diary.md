[ Beginners Guide to Udev in Linux – The Geek Diary](<
https://www.thegeekdiary.com/beginners-guide-to-udev-in-linux/>) –Udev is
really cryptic and advanced. It is often hard to trobuleshoot if you need to.
What is it? Udev is the device manager for the Linux kernel. Udev dynamically
creates or removes device node files at boot time in the /dev directory for
all types of devices. Udev is now part of systemd as you can see by viewing
the “udev” file names included with the systemd RPM package.
