I want to do an electricity audit for my house. I am looking for a web site
that lets me complete a survey of all my  
electricity consuming devices and estimates my KWh. I suspect there may be
many of these, is there one you recommend?

I know it's really easy to do 'by hand', but I think there must be someone who
did the research of how much power a Staples paper shredder uses when it's on
but not in use, and on, and on and on.
