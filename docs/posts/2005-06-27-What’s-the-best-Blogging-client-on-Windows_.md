>>

>> You can do your blogging by typing into a web browser form provided by the
Movable Type service. But boy is that clumsy and awful.

>>

>> So for a while now I've used so-called **" blogging clients"** which
provide a nice rich interface to write and edit the posts, and then use the
server's APIs to actually send the update or change up to the server.

>>

>> On Mac, I use the fairly wonderful [Ecto for OS X](<http://ecto.kung-
foo.tv/>) - **Recommended**!

>>

>> On Windows, I **tried** all the free ones that I found recommended, and
only w.bloggar was stable enough to actually use, although I didn't like the
user interface. I also tried tried ShartMT and Ecto for Windows.

>>

>> Despite my best efforts, neither one was stable enough to use. In the end,
I found and am now using the [BlogJet ](<http://blogjet.com/>)- **Clean and
simple.**
