Marc Andreeson has a [really good, optimistic article in the Wall Street
Journal about the future foundational role of Software in all industries of

A fine article. One thing that does go through my mind is that even though he
cites opportunity after opportunity in the full article, my observation is
that it is quite hard nowadays to get people to pay for software in any form.
We've gotten used to free, even in the enterprise. Yes some do succeed, big,
but many many do not make it.

You must have a deep, illogical, passionate belief in your company and then
you have to actually be really really good at execution.
