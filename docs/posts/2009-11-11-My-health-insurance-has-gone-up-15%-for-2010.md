# [My health insurance has gone up 15% for 2010](None)




Yeah, I just received the renewal paperwork for health insurance, and i **t 's
up**. This is with [Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Massachusetts](<http://www.bluecrossma.com/common/en_US/index.jsp>), with whom
I have been having a fine experience. I am **happy** with the service, and the
responsiveness.

But from 2009 to 2010, **my bill is up 15%. Wow.**
