An interesting [article by David Brooks in the New York Times commenting on
the views of the always controversial Peter
Thiel.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-creative-
monopoly.html?_r=1>)

[Why is he controversial? Because he h[as a grant program for students who are
so passionate about their startup idea that they are willing to drop out of
college to get the grant](<http://www.thielfellowship.org/become-a-
fellow/about-the-program/>). Which is ironic because in the article, Brooks is
citing what Thiel is teaching in his Stanford COURSE!]

The article is about Thiel's views on what and how students get taught in
college:

> "First, students have to jump through ever-more demanding, preassigned
> academic hoops. Instead of developing a passion for one subject, they're
> rewarded for becoming professional students, getting great grades across all
> subjects, regardless of their intrinsic interests.
>
> Instead of wandering across strange domains, they have to prudentially
> apportion their time, making productive use of each hour." (from [The
> Creative Monopoly)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-
> creative-monopoly.html?_r=1>)

Why would that be bad? Read on:

> "… We live in a culture that nurtures competitive skills. And they are
> necessary: discipline, rigor and reliability. But it’s probably a good idea
> to try to supplement them with the skills of the creative monopolist:
> alertness, independence and the ability to reclaim forgotten traditions."

> Monopoly)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-creative-
> monopoly.html?_r=1>)
