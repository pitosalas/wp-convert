I just finished reading the book
[Seabiscuit](<http://www.amazon.com/Seabiscuit-American-Legend-Laura-
Hillenbrand/dp/0449005615>). I previously had no interest (and no respect) for
[Horse Racing](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing>). The book changed
that. It was quite interesting in human and racing terms.

Now that I think about it I am also a big fan of the [Dick Francis mystery
series.](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Francis>) Unfortunately he's no
longer with us, and I think I've read all of them. They are more about British
[steeplechase](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeplechase>), but still, about
horses. So I guess there was a latent interest there ðŸ™‚

Anyway, one take away was how many **every day English words** and expressions
in daily use come from the **Racing World.** See how many surprise you!

  * track record
  * neck-a-neck
  * by a nose
  * also ran
  * dead heat
  * photo finish
  * tongue tied
  * down to the wire
