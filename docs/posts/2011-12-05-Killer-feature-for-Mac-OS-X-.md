What if when I typed into the search box in Safari (Mac OS X's web browser)
the text is interpreted by Siri? I could type "What's the weather tomorrow"
and it would display a forecast for tomorrow, or type "text my wife that I
love her" and it would initiate a text message to my wife. **Wouldn 't that be
cool?**

I just typed into the search box "Is Kashi a company?" because I was in a Siri
kind of mood, and of course I didn't get a good answer. But maybe Siri on my
iPhone would have known. (**Update:** I just tried it, and it didn't but
still, I think it's a cool idea!)
