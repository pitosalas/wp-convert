[Interesting article about the sale of
DVDs](<http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/9/forget-itunes-americans-still-love-
to-buy-dvds>) in Silicon Alley Insider:

> "Just a reality check on the video download/rental business: There  
> really isn't one yet. At least not compared to good old-fashioned DVD  
> sales and rentals." (from "[Forget iTunes: Americans still love to buy
> DVDs](<http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/9/forget-itunes-americans-still-
> love-to-buy-dvds>)")

Interesting article. I wonder, what about music CDs?
