There has been a lot of traffic on this new meme "Folksonomies". This
[Slashdot bit ](<http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/04/0117245>)has many
of the important links in it, and I can't say that I've read all of it, so
what I am describing below may be old hat. I am thinking that while
Folksonomies is a kind of catchy, although hard to say or spell word, it is
too narrow. Folksonomies, as I understand, refers to a community based way of
arriving at a taxonomy of information, basically subjective judgements on what
the information is **" about." **We've seen this in http://del.icio.us and in
http://www.flickr.com. It seems to me that there are all kinds of meta data,
some subjective, and some **objective,** which could use the general idea of
collaborative classification.  For example within
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>), a blog reader, we are building the
ability for any user to identify the Country of origin of a certain feed. This
is an objective fact, but not one that is easily ascertained.  We want to use
the knowledge of the community to find out **this fact**. The experiment is to
let any user record what they think the right country is, and relying (or
**betting**) that this will be self-policing, and that people will not be
inclined to hack or vandalize this item of information.  I think this is a
useful **generalization** of the notion of **folksonomies**. Whether the term
Collaborative Classification is a better will be decided by the mysterious
dynamics of blog-meme-flow.
