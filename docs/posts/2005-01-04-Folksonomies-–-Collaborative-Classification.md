There has been a lot of traffic on this new meme "Folksonomies". This
[Slashdot bit ](<http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/04/0117245>)has many
of the important links in it, and I can't say that I've read all of it, so
what I am describing below may be old hat.

>>

>> I am thinking that while Folksonomies is a kind of catchy, although hard to
say or spell word, it is too narrow. Folksonomies, as I understand, refers to
a community based way of arriving at a taxonomy of information, basically
subjective judgements on what the information is **" about." **We've seen this
in http://del.icio.us and in http://www.flickr.com.

>>

>> It seems to me that there are all kinds of meta data, some subjective, and
some **objective,** which could use the general idea of collaborative
classification.

>>

>> For example within [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>), a blog
reader, we are building the ability for any user to identify the Country of
origin of a certain feed. This is an objective fact, but not one that is
easily ascertained.

>>

>> We want to use the knowledge of the community to find out **this fact**.
The experiment is to let any user record what they think the right country is,
and relying (or **betting** ) that this will be self-policing, and that people
will not be inclined to hack or vandalize this item of information.

>>

>> I think this is a useful **generalization** of the notion of
**folksonomies**. Whether the term Collaborative Classification is a better
will be decided by the mysterious dynamics of blog-meme-flow.
