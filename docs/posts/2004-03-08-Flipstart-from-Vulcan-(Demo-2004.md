**[Flipstart](<http://www.flipstartpc.com/>) from Vulcan (Demo 2004 Series -
9): **This is a **weird little** device. It's essentially a Windows XP
computer using thumb keyboard. The dimensions are (from memory, now 4″ x 6″ x
1″) It has a 30Gig disk, and fast chip. It also has built in Wi-Fi. It has a
port replicator allowing full size keyboard and screen to be attached. The
screen is very high resolution. All in all it looks attractive and **kind of
useful**.

you would come up with if you started with a **blank slate** , etc.

>> Watching the demo and then playing with it, I have to say that it didn't
really live up to that claim. I heard this comment repeated by several show
attendees. To me, it was, as David Roux used to say, **" Just a PC with the
air sucked out of it."**

founder, with Bill Gates, of Microsoft. At least that's how I read the
geneology.
