Saw this in the newspaper today - ["Mars Rover Visits Crater, Then Poses for a Picture.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/science/space/07rover.html>). Also here's an article with some links to the high res snaps of the rover: [NASA's Mars Rover and Orbiter Team Examines Victoria Crater | SpaceRef - Your Space Reference](<http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.rss.html?pid=21010> " NASA's Mars Rover and Orbiter Team Examines Victoria Crater | SpaceRef - Your Space Reference"). You gotta love this stuff!
