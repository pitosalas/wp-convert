I recently saw a Nova episode about Hany Farid about so called "Digital
Forensics", that is how to detect and discover photos manipulated digitally.
Here are some useful links if you are interested:

out this photo which appeared in all the papers yesterday.

When I saw it, I didn't think Photoshop, but I did wonder how we knew that
this photo had actually been taken in Iran and recently.

It looked like any number of missile launch photos.

But check this out:
