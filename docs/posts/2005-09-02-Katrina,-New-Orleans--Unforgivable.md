I don't have anything to add, but here are some incredible bits that I came
across:

>>

>>   * [Daily Kos: "Left
Behind"](<http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/2/31040/36581>)

>>   * [Andreson Cooper:
Transcript](<http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/01/acd.01.html>)

>>   * [Durham Intdependent Weekly, 9/22/2004!, "Disaster in the
making"](<http://www.indyweek.com/durham/2004-09-22/cover.htm>)

>>   * [Dave Winer: Scientific American Article in
2001](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/09/02#When:7:10:14AM>)

>>

There's lots more but just read those and follow their links. And our
President said: "No one could have foreseen this". Huh? "What, me worry?"
