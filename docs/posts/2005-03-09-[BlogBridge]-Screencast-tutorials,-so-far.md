There are two very brief audio-visual overviews of 'cool' BlogBridge features.

>>

>>   * **BlogStarz feature:**[ in this brief
screencast](<http://www.blogbridge.com/movies/overview.mov>) I introduce and
explain a handy way to rate which feeds you find most useful, and at the same
time benefit from the experience of other users.

>>   * **Automatic highlighting in articles:**[In this brief screencast,
](<http://www.blogbridge.com/movies/highlights.mov>)I show how BlogBridge will
highlight words and phrases in green (link to a feed I am already following),
red (link to a feed that is new to me) or blue (specific words or phrases
which are interesting to me.)

Let me know what you think. Useful? Does it work with your browser on your
platform?
