**Link: [[BlogBridge] Screencast tutorials, so far](None):** ""

There are two very brief audio-visual overviews of 'cool' BlogBridge features.

>>

>>   * **BlogStarz feature:**[ in this brief
screencast](<http://www.blogbridge.com/movies/overview.mov>) I introduce and
explain a handy way to rate which feeds you find most useful, and at the same
time benefit from the experience of other users.

>>   * **Automatic highlighting in articles:**[In this brief screencast,
](<http://www.blogbridge.com/movies/highlights.mov>)I show how BlogBridge will
highlight words and phrases in green (link to a feed I am already following),
red (link to a feed that is new to me) or blue (specific words or phrases
which are interesting to me.)

>>

>> Let me know what you think. Useful? Does it work with your browser on your
platform?
