# [N.E.A.T. Product from Gruve: Fact or Fiction?](None)




There's something about this [Gruve
product](<http://stores.homestead.com/Gruve/StoreFront.bok>) that bugs me:

> "The Gruve Solution is a new, completely revolutionary approach to weight
> management that incorporates the landmark discovery of N.E.A.T. (Non
> Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) which is all the calories one burns while
> doing normal (non-exercise) daily activity. Scientific research over 10
> years found that increasing the N.E.A.T in daily life results in sustainable
> weight loss and a dramatic improvement in overall health. In other words,
> increasing daily N.E.A.T. activity is more effective at achieving
> sustainable weight loss and control than short term intense exercise!"

All the superlatives and buzz words, and then the promises. They also seem
overblown. It just seems like a glorified pedometer.

Next is the price: $179 for the device, and then an annual subscription after
year one of another $80.00.

While apparently Non Exercise Activity Thermogenesis has some coverage in 'the
literature', I had to find that connection myself, there seems to be no
mention of it on the web site. Another thing that makes me wonder.

What do you know?
