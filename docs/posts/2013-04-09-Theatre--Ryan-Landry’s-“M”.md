We saw "[Ryan Landry's "M"" at the Calderwood Pavilion in the South
End](<http://www.goldstar.com/e/65476>) last weekend. I started out a bit
suspiciously when the playwright (who's not famous) name is part of the name
of the play being promoted. The play is based on a famous film "M". Here's a
bit from an interview:

> When asked, "A German film from 1931 about a child killer … what made you
> want to turn this into a play?" Landry says: "Because it is a beautiful
> masterwork. A goal to which other artists should aspire. I chose this film
> because I wanted to write a play based on the most unfunny thing in the
> world and still make it [the play] funny. It is a sad play too. It is a
> human play" (from
> [interview](<http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/blogs/bostonspirit/2013/03/ryan_landry_dishes_on_m_at_the.html>))

My review: I was surprised that I liked it (didn't love it.) For me the play
was not about a story - there was no discernible emotion or character
development. For me it was fun, like the circus is fun - a spectacle.

Overall while I am on the topic: I've [enjoyed this season of the Huntington
Theatre tremendously](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org>), definitely one of
the best seasons that I remember. (I'm no theatre expert by the way, so take
that as purely one person's subjective opinion).

The [Huntington is doing something great on their web site lately with
media.](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/2012-2013/m/>) They capture
behind the scenes videos, interviews, and trailer-like promos of the plays. A
really wonderful way to embrace social and multi media.
