# [Notice the new del.icio.us feature I am using?](None)



>>

>> The feature isn't new, it's actually pretty **old**. It's also very poorly
documented. But it's **new** to me. I've configured del.icio.us to
automatically create a post to my blog of all the tags I've submitted in the
last 24 hours.

>>

>> If you are a del.icio.us user, look under "settings", "experimental",
"daily blog posting" for the setting. Then ask me or google for an
**explanation** of what the fields mean.

>>

>> Combined with the [Tagging feature in
BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2005/07/blogbridge_does.php>),
it allows me to post to my blog (virtually) with almost no effort. So when I
am traveling (like I was the last 2 days) I can still show some semblance of
activity on my blog. Very **cool**.

>>

>> Will it make me a **lazy blogger**? What's a lazy blogger anyway?
