We were on vacation in Greece and Turkey a few weeks ago and I noticed many
TripAdvisor Certificate of this or that, hanging in windows of random shops on
remote islands (and big cities) and I got to thinking, are these for real? Is
there a simple way to get a counterfiet certificate? It's just a piece of
paper and I somehow doubt that TripAdvisor in Massachusetts USA is aware that
"The Citadel" shop on Santanelli is sporting a fake certificate.
