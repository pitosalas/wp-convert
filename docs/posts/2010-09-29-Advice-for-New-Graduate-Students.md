If you know anyone in graduate school (oops, or if you are in graduate school
yourself, or planning to go to one), this is interesting reading: [Advice for
New Graduate Students](<http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/jrex/advice-new-
graduate-students>) from [Freedom to Tinker](<http://freedom-to-
tinker.com/rss.xml>):

> _[Ed Felten says: This is the time of year when professors offer advice to
> new students. My colleague Prof. Jennifer Rexford gave a great talk to a
> group of our incoming engineering Ph.D. students, about how to make the most
> of graduate school. Here 's what she said: ]_
>
> Those of you who know me, know that I collect quotations as a hobby. (The
> short version of the story is that I moved around a lot as a kid. Quotations
> are small and very portable, making them a good hobby.) Anyway, two eminent
> scientists, Albert Einstein and Lewis Thomas, who were at Princeton the
> 1930s both have something interesting (and seemingly contradictory) to say
> about the role of the individual:
>

>> Albert Einstein (physics): "All that is valuable in human society depends
upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual."

>>

>> Lewis Thomas (medicine, biology, Princeton class of '33): "There is really
no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a
cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin."

>
> These two quotations embody so much of what graduate school is all about.
>
> _Individual Development_
>
> First, graduate school is a highly individual experience. Compared to the
> somewhat anonymous experience of college -- where you sit in large classes,
> do the same homeworks, and take the same tests with many other students --
> graduate school is a highly personal. Nobody else is doing quite the same
> research you are doing (or at least you _hope_ they are not), and you get
> direct (sometimes pointed) feedback on your individual work -- from your
> advisor, from your peers, and from reviewers of the papers you submit and
> the talks you give. And when your work is good but not great, you don't just
> take the A- and move on to the next assignment -- you keep plugging away and
> get more feedback and, eventually, you nail it. This is an amazingly
> efficient way to learn, grow, and create great scholarship.
>
> Yet, there is a downside. The critique of your work, however well-meaning
> and "good for you," will sometimes feel relentless. It requires some
> toughening of the skin, and a delicate little dance to simultaneously be in
> love with your work (so you have the tenacity you need to always dig deeper)
> and yet have enough emotional distance to be able to take constructive
> criticism of how your work looks in its early stages. It's not an easy
> balance to strike, and I'm sure all of us who do research still struggle
> with it. I know I do. This is one of the many ways in which grad school is
> as much as emotional challenge as it is an intellectual one.
>
> Another important aspect of the "individual" in graduate school is to learn
> your research "taste." You may not know it yet, but you are weird. You come
> to research problems with some peculiar sensibility that nobody else has.
> You are attracted to a certain kind of research problem -- maybe a messy
> practical problem, or a sharply formulated (but very hard) theoretical
> problem, or something in between. You notice a certain kind of weakness or
> gap in other people's research. You have a particular set of techniques or
> approaches to solving problems. Graduate school is a wonderful time to
> figure out what your "taste" is, so you can craft your own agenda for the
> technical problems you pursue in the years ahead.
>
> So, then, graduate school really is the epitome of what Einstein called the
> "development of the individual." And I hope during your time here, you get
> the kind of opportunities for individual development that you deserve.
> Experiences that will let you produce deeper scholarship that expands the
> base of knowledge in your fields, and become more accomplished at conveying
> new and sometimes complex ideas to others.
>
> _Part of a Group_
>
> Yet, for all of my blathering on about the individual, graduate school is
> also a collective experience. You are part of a research group, a
> department, a discipline, (for many of you) an engineering school, a
> graduate school, and student groups like GWISE.
>
> I want to say a few words about your research group, because it is so
> important. Your officemates, and the other graduate students around you, are
> such an important part of your graduate school experience. Not only do they
> provide a sense of community, and a community that truly understands your
> experiences, though that is certainly important. But they also mentor you on
> topics small and large.
>
> I had a great officemate, Jim, in graduate school. He took ten years to
> graduate, and had already been there seven years when I arrived. So, Jim
> knew everything about everything. He taught me an important lesson I value
> to this day -- how to be efficient. He would sit at the next desk and
> admonishingly say, "Jen, I hear the sounds of repetitive keystrokes. Today
> you will learn Perl." To be honest, it was kind of creepy at first, but Jim
> would watch out for me out of the corner of his eye. He taught me things
> that would save me time, leaving me with the time and energy I needed to
> tackle bigger and more interesting problems.
>
> Your classmates will also provide wonderful moments of professional
> serendipity, random encounters over coffee or foosball that make you aware
> of a body of work you didn't know about, or recognize a previously
> unappreciated connection between two disciplines. You may even become the
> match-maker for the faculty, bringing two professors together to collaborate
> because you see a connection in their research that they were unable to see.
> The chance encounters, the candid feedback on your research, the unplanned
> discussions about research taste and philosophy -- these are all a great
> part of interacting with your group mates.
>
> I must caution you, though, about an important enemy against this kind of
> informal interactions. The Internet. Okay, so my research focuses on the
> Internet, so it may seem strange for me to be so negative about it, but this
> is important so I'll make an exception. The Internet makes it far too easy
> to work from home, or a cafe, or on the train, rather than in your office or
> lab with your peers. Your choice to work away from the office is, in fact,
> perfectly rational. Coming into the office has a defined cost, in terms of
> your time and (perhaps) having to get out of your pajamas and take a shower.
> And, all of this is in exchange for some vague, speculative benefit -- that
> you might have a chance encounter that truly changes your research. And,
> frankly, in any one day, you probably _won 't_ have a profound experience in
> your office, and your officemates may not even be in the same scholarly mood
> as you. But, I entreat you to go anyway.
>
> And, I encourage you to have a broader sense of community with each other,
> whether in your departments, or the school of engineering, or in groups like
> this one. Not only for the professional serendipity -- though that will
> happen. But for the friendship and support. Graduate school is fun but it is
> also hard, and sometimes frustrating, and having some balance in your life
> will make the whole experience more worthwhile.
>
> In fact, for what it's worth, I find the students in my group who are more
> engaged with other students and student groups often graduate _sooner_ than
> the other students. They often are better at managing their time, working
> intensely and efficiently to leave space in their lives for their other
> pursuits. And, they are more comfortable reaching out to other students for
> help, whether for feedback on a paper or guidance on an analytical technique
> or a software tool. They know more about the peculiarities of the faculty,
> and how to work around them. And, for the students who are not native
> English speakers, the social interactions also have a side benefit of
> sharpening their English skills. Mastering a language is, frankly, pretty
> boring work. Socializing in English is a much more enjoyable way to learn
> the language than any formal study could ever be.
>
> So, in closing, I do think that graduate school is an unusual experience,
> both highly individual (in your training and professional development) and
> highly collective (in how you are part of a research group, a discipline,
> and a larger community). I hope you find both aspects of your time here at
> Princeton rewarding, and that you also make time to give back to the next
> group of students who arrive at Princeton after you. ( **from:**[Advice for
