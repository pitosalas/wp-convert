I've been learning and thinking about Facebook applications, which everyone
else is also writing and thinking aboutâ€¦ I will be posting about some of the
interesting facts and insights as they come up.

This one is fairly obvious if you think about it, but it may be a useful
reminder.

_Facebook applications don 't ever let you actually store anything on the
Facebook servers/service themselves. _

In other words, let's say you add a really cool Facebook application that
let's you display and share all the books you have read, and let all your
friends do the same. Everyone is writing reviews and marking thumbs up and
down on these books, organizing them into bookshelves and what not.

All of that information is being stored somewhere else, not "at facebook".
That is, not on their servers, under their control, under their security,
backup and availability. They don't have any responsibility over it.

When you use the Facebook application it sure looks like everyone and
everything is under one umbrella, but it's not.

Why might this matter?

  * If the server on which your application's information breaks or dies, your information is offline or lost, irrespective of how big and powerful Facebook Inc is.

  * While Facebook might have assured you that they will only allow authorized people to see, change or delete your info, this assurance does not apply to the information you entered via the application.

These observations are not profound and they are obvious from the structure of
Facebook applications. But they are easy to overlook or assume wrongly.

**Update:** I just read a [relevant post in Bill Ives
blog](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/WGHl/~3/220266376/worklights-
work.html>) about a new service called Workbook. [Workbook is a Facebook
application](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/WGHl/~3/220266376/worklights-
work.html>) which allows users to access some of their secure information
apparently through Facebook. Not the same as what I am talking about above,
but relevant.
