You've seen and heard of [Twitter](<http://twitter.com/home>), haven't you? If
not, congratulations for being immune to the latest Fad 2.0.

Other than the occasional "I just had a delicious hamburger", many if not most
of my tweets are an announcement (read traffic bait) of one thing or another,
usually including a link.

Why would I subscribe to that? Maybe I have the wrong kind of friends.

I think if your twitter friends are really people who are actual friends
(Friends 1.0) and not quote friends unquote (Friends 2.0) then you might
actually care about them having a delicious hamburger.

But do you know that actually has 350 friends (1.0?)
