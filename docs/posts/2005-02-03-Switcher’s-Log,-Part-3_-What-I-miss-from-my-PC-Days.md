**Link: [Switcher’s Log, Part 3: What I miss from my PC Days](None):** ""

In the continuing saga of the switch from Windows XP to Mac OS X, here is
where we find our hero…. I have more or less gotten all the applications I use
over onto the Mac. Almost all of them. I will be forced to leave behind
**Microsoft Money, X1 and Plaxo**. Of all the stuff I ran on the PC, those are
the only three that I miss. And in each case I can get by. [Microsoft
Money](<http://www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx>) - well there's Quicken
for Mac, which is analogous. But transferring the data over seems like it will
be a huge mess costing time, frustration and in the end producing an
unsatisfactory result. [X1](<http://www.x1.com/>) - My wonderful desktop
search. I already miss it. My only consolation is that the next release of OS
X will include something called "SpotLight" which is supposed to be totally
amazing and will change my life. [Plaxo](<http://www.plaxo.com/>) - Who would
have thunk? But this business of typing and maintaining people's contact
information by hand can become pretty tiresome. I'd settle for a Mac version
of[ GetAnagram.com](<http://getanagram.com/>), but that of course doesn't
exist. Thinking about what software exists and doesn't exist on Mac, and why,
can be sobering. I don't know the figures, but let's say that Mac accounts for
5 or so percent of the PC Installed base.  Put that way, it makes you feel
like your brandy new shiny new computer has moved you to a small,
underpopulated corner of the computing universe where the buses don't run.
Will GetAnagram or Plaxo ever have a Mac OS X version? Not likely. What
computer will I be using 10 years from now?
