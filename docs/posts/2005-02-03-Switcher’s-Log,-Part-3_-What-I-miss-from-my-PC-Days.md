# [Switcher’s Log, Part 3: What I miss from my PC Days](None)


In the continuing saga of the switch from Windows XP to Mac OS X, here is
where we find our hero….

>>

>> I have more or less gotten all the applications I use over onto the Mac.
Almost all of them. I will be forced to leave behind **Microsoft Money, X1 and
Plaxo**. Of all the stuff I ran on the PC, those are the only three that I
miss. And in each case I can get by.

>>

>> [Microsoft Money](<http://www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx>) - well
there's Quicken for Mac, which is analogous. But transferring the data over
seems like it will be a huge mess costing time, frustration and in the end
producing an unsatisfactory result.

>>

>> [X1](<http://www.x1.com/>) - My wonderful desktop search. I already miss
it. My only consolation is that the next release of OS X will include
something called "SpotLight" which is supposed to be totally amazing and will
change my life.

>>

>> [Plaxo](<http://www.plaxo.com/>) - Who would have thunk? But this business
of typing and maintaining people's contact information by hand can become
pretty tiresome. I'd settle for a Mac version of[
GetAnagram.com](<http://getanagram.com/>), but that of course doesn't exist.

>>

>> Thinking about what software exists and doesn't exist on Mac, and why, can
be sobering. I don't know the figures, but let's say that Mac accounts for 5
or so percent of the PC Installed base.

>>

>> Put that way, it makes you feel like your brandy new shiny new computer has
moved you to a small, underpopulated corner of the computing universe where
the buses don't run. Will GetAnagram or Plaxo ever have a Mac OS X version?
Not likely.

>>

>> What computer will I be using 10 years from now?
