**Link: [Costco rental car discount](None):** ""



I've been a member of [Costco](<http://www.costco.com/>) for years. Yeah, you
always buy more stuff there than you intended, but it's so much fun!

I uncovered today that Costco also has **great discounts** for travel, rental
cars in particular. If you are not part of a big corporate program, call
Costco Travel, ask for your rental car company, and you get connected to their
'Costco Desk' (is it a real desk?). Anyway, the point is I got a real nice
discount over what the default [Hertz web site ](<http://www.hertz.com>)price
or [Kayak](<http://www.kayak.com>) deal was. Just a
[LifeHack](<http://www.lifehacker.com/>) for you.
