>> Just a quick note of the **very nice** mention of BlogBridge by almost-
famous [Dowbrigade](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dowbrigade/>) blog by the
incredibly prolific Michael Feldman.

>>

>>> (Emphasis mine, throughout)

>>>

>>> Blog Bridge is the amazing new RSS reader and aggregator from Pito Salas.
Sure, it makes it **easy** to subscribe, arrange, view and blog from anything
with an RSS feed.

>>>

>>> **But what really sets it apart** is that it is written completely in
**Java** , which means that it is platform-independent, works on any computer
connected to the interenet, and it remembers not only what you are subscribed
to, but which articles you have already read, or saved, or filed to read
later. From anywhere, on any machine.

>>>

>>> Being used to the much simpler aggregator built into Manila, it took us a
while to discover the utility of moving feeds into channels and groups, but
now it seems **second nature**.

>>>

>>> There are suggested sample groupings to get beginners started, pre-
packaged packets of feeds, which you can easily modify by adding and dropping
feeds. (from

>> Wow, **thanks** Michael!
