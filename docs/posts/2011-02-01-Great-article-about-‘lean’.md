[I recommend this article, "Fatboy in A Lean
World"](<http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-in-a-lean-world/>), (by
[Gordon Guthrie](<http://www.oreillygmt.eu/author/gordon-guthrie/>)) if you
are interested in 'lean' as in Lean Startups, Lean Production.

About why lean production is becoming so hot among us software entrepreneurs:

> The great transformation of the industry over the last 10 years has been the
> availability of already-written (and battle tested) software which has
> slashed the size of a team that can build a functioning product and the
> crash in price of hardware. (**from**[ Fatboy in a Lean
> World](<http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-in-a-lean-world/>))

About Y-Combinator's philosophy:

> The YCombinator slogan is build things people want. Lean production is the
> double negative of that: don’t build things people don’t want.
> (**from**[Fatboy in a Lean
> World](<http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-in-a-lean-world/>))

About one of the key concepts of lean, the "minimum viable product" or MVP:

> "Like all hot concepts there is a lifecycle of hype. When people realise it
> is useful they first start by re-categorising everything they all ready do
> as the flavour de jour. Then it blooms and blooms and starts being applied
> quite wildly.
>
> An example of this would be the rise of paper prototypes as MVP’s. Paper
> prototypes are a great and cheap way of working out design and interface
> issues but they need to be tempered with capability.
>
> I could knock up a paper prototype of an iPhone teleportation app and get
> great customer stats (‘96% of 14-25 year olds would def-in-et-ely pay $1,000
> for this app, right here, right now!’). But without capability it is just
> piss and wind.
>
> Patrick Vlaskovits and Eric Ries would define an MVP loosely as ‘enough
> product to test a hypothesis’ – and would insist that if it isn’t testing a
> hypothesis, then it isn’t an MVP.
>
> I am all in favour of testing hypothesis by the cheapest mechanisms
> possible, but my gut instinct is that you probably should not call it an MVP
> unless it is a product – a product that you are actually trying to sell,
> right here, right now. An MVP, after all, is a Minimum Viable Product. If
> your users are not your users (but your product) you should be thinking how
> do I get enough users to ‘sell’ to whoever your customers are (lead
> generation, advertisers, market information, whatever). (**from**[Fatboy in
> a Lean World](<http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-in-a-lean-world/>)
