A **useful** article in the New York Times today, just in time for the
holidays. A[ new site that tries to forecast the best time to buy that item
you really want. ](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/business/fridays-deals-
may-not-be-the-best.html>)It seems to draw a graph showing how the price of,
for example, a Nikon 50-300mm Zoom Lens has varied over the last 3 months and
whether I should buy it today or wait till next month. It's a very nicely done
site and if it works, it could be very useful. The site is
[decide.com.](<http://www.decide.com/>)
