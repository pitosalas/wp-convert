My Treo 600 recently died a hard death. I had to learn a new cell phone, a
relatively low end one, and it was a serious undertaking.

Someone I know recently did a 90 minute drive in 3.5 hours because their car's
GPS inadvertently was set in the 'avoid highways' settings and they were in
unfamiliar territory, without a map, and so had no choice but to follow the
long way.

I've seen this idea suggested elsewhere, but how a cell phone for people who
don't read manuals? Why can't a cell phone be as easy to operate as a regular
telephone? (Yes, the new home cordless sets with built in answering machines
are almost as complex as cell phones!)

It seems someone [has finally done it!
