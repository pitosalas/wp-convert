Listen, I **love** the New York Times. I read it cover to cover (or pixel to
pixel) every day and have it delivered in dead-tree format to my doorstep each
morning.

But so often I come across an awkward sentence which I have to read and re-
read several times to understand.

I've been noticing this for a long time now and it makes me wonder whether
it's a stylistic thing or a that they have had to **lay off** their best
editors.

At any rate, I don't have the same impression when I read he Wall Street
Journal (which I **admire** but **don 't** love.)

Here's a recent example:

> "LAGOS, Nigeria -- In a quarter-century, at the rate Nigeria is growing, 300
> million people -- a population about as big as that of the present-day
> United States -- will live in a country roughly the size of Arizona, New
> Mexico and Nevada." (from
> [NYT](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/world/africa/in-nigeria-a-preview-
> of-an-overcrowded-planet.html>))

What do you say, am I crazy?
