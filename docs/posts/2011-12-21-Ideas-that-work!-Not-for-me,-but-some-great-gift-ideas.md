I know my own Christmas/Channukah gifts have already been purchased by Santa.
So this is not for me, but I saw a bunch of cool ideas on this list, so I
thought I would share it! Check this post [10 Great Gifts For Photographers
Under
$20](<http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DigitalPhotographySchool/~3/cZxlhJvFML4/10-great-
gifts-for-photographers-under-20>) from [Digital Photography
School](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/digitalphotographyschool>):

> "It’s that time of year again – the time when most of us photographers find

> Nikon D700,” the cold, hard reality is if we don’t want a gift certificate
> for a hair cut or something worse, we’re better off giving the inquiring
> gift-giver options under $20. Here is a great list of affordable gift
> suggestions that will put a smile on any photographers face just in time for
> the holidays!" (**from** [Digital Photography School)](<http://www.digital-
