# [Suckered again by Microsoft?](None)


I've been using **Microsoft Money** (their personal finance package) for years
now (after having switched from Quicken probably 5 years ago.) I really like
it, for what it is.

>>

>> In January of each of the last few years it seems, I shell out another $60
for the latest **" upgrade"**, install it, and immediately **kick** myself
when I find almost no new functionality.

>>

>> It seems like the graphic designers get a turn to play with all the art
work and colors but as far as new functionality, **nothing**. I wouldn't be
surprised if the M$ is down to 4 people, with the highest operating margin of
any product.

>>

>> This has gone so far now, that they **don 't even pretend **by putting a
"What's new in this release" on the box!

>>

>> Oh and then there's the **rebate**. I've been screwed by rebate offers
(Microsoft and others) so often it's not even funny. I doggedly document, make
copies, add reminders to my calendar, and on and on, for a measily $15 rebate,
which half the time never happens.

>>

>> How about the fact that there are like 400 different flavors of Microsoft
Money - you know: M$ Basic (free after rebate), M$ In-between ($5 after
rebate), M$ Advanced, Super-Advanced, Dirt-cheap, Microsoft Money "We'll pay
you to take it off your hands"

>>

>> And still, year after year, **I fall for it.** A perfect **pawn** for their
marketing machine. Anyone else out there have the same experience?
