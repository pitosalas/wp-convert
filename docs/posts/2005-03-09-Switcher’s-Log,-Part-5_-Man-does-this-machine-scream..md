**Link: [Switcher’s Log, Part 5: Man does this machine scream.](None):** ""

For those who are following this narrative, this is a continuing narrative of
my experiences after having **switched** from Windows XP to Mac OS X. One of
my big concerns before switching to Mac was that it was going to be
**sloooooow**. Of course this is an unfair comparison, between:

>>

>>   * a 2GHz Pentium on a 2 year old Dell with 1 Gig of Memory and

>>   * a brand new G5, 1.8 GHz x 2 (dual processor), with 2 Gigabytes of
memory.

But you wouldn't believe the rumors and legends out there about Macs being
slow, or the fact that you can't compare a Pentium MHz to a G5 MHz… I was
**worried** : perhaps the Mac OS was slower or different; and anyway would it
actually be able to take advantage of the dual CPU for day to day use? The
bottom line: it **screams**! Builds are fast, opening apps is fast, moving
windows around is fast, Ripping CDs is really fast. It's really fast!
