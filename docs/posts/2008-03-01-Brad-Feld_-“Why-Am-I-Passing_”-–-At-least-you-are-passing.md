Brad Feld, **famous Venture Capitalis** t writes an interesting post about how
he might get to the point of telling an entrepreneur "**we are passing** " in
[this
post](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FeldThoughts/~3/243320976/why_am_i_passin.html>)
from [Feld Thoughts](<http://www.feld.com/blog/>):

**Couldn 't agree more!** I've seen it happen more than once that people are
just **strung along** and strung along and never actually get a "No" for all
kinds of reasons. It's **refreshing and it should be appreciated** when a
potential investor reaches a definitive conclusion, even if it's a "No."
