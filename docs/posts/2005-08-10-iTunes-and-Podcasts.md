**Link: [iTunes and Podcasts](None):** ""

This is just a quickie: did you know that you can just drag and drop the URL
of a Podcast RSS feed (a.k.a. an RSS Feed with enclosures) onto the Podcasts
list in iTunes? In other words, you don't need to surf the Apple iTunes
catalog looking for your favorite show if you have the URL. This is especially
handy if the Podcast you want to listen to has not made it to their catalog.
