# [iTunes and Podcasts](None)



>>

>> This is just a quickie: did you know that you can just drag and drop the
URL of a Podcast RSS feed (a.k.a. an RSS Feed with enclosures) onto the
Podcasts list in iTunes? In other words, you don't need to surf the Apple
iTunes catalog looking for your favorite show if you have the URL. This is
especially handy if the Podcast you want to listen to has not made it to their
catalog.
