How much do you want to bet that somewhere someone in this country a malware
or other attack is being launched against the new ["Obamacare" Web
site?](<http://www.healthcare.gov>)

I have great sympathy for the team(s) that put up that web site, back end and
other support infrastructure for this site. And in the best of possible
conditions there will be hiccups in deploying such a complex system. Add to
that that at 8:00am today everyone on earth knew that the site was up and that
they could start playing with it, and you are facing a real challenge. So
don't be surprised if there's a small or big hiccup in the first few weeks and
months.

But it occurred to me that over and above that, there are so many haters in
this country (and probably around the world) that there almost certainly are
concious and malicious attacks being waged to corrupt, disrupt, bring down,
slow down, or steal data from this service, all in an effort to embarass us in
front of all the world.

I really really hope this isn't true, but, I wouldn't put it past them.
