Fun article about Ben Hescott who has some unique - and **impressive** -
approaches to teaching an abstract topic:

> **Q.** Did you experience an "aha'' teaching moment?
>
> **A.** My first time teaching, I was using PowerPoint slides. One student
> kept saying, "I don't see it.'' So I turned off the computer, grabbed a
> piece of chalk, and went through the material slowly on the blackboard,
> without notes. Afterward, the kid said, "You're a really good teacher when
> you're not using PowerPoint.'' That changed everything." (**from** [The
> Boston
> Globe](<http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-14/news/29657519_1_teaching-
> moment-computer-giggle>))

You have to [read the whole
interview!](<http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-14/news/29657519_1_teaching-
