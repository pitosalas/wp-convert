First the **punchline** : [go to this link, fill out a short
questionaire,](<http://www.successandyou.net/RAC/>) and receive a $15
Starbucks gift card in the mail, no questions asked. But hurry, because I
wouldn't be surprised if that offer evaporates quickly.

>>

>> Here is one of those cool "**internet effects. "** There's a site called
[DealNews ](<http://www.dealnews.com>)where you can immediate reports of
interesting offers, coupons, deals, etc. They are posted there by I don't know
who - people without a life. They also [have an RSS Feed
](<http://content.dealnews.com/dealnews/rss/last-twenty.xml>)for you
[BlogBridge ](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)users. That's how I found out about
the offer.

>>

>> Anyway, some Oracle Reseller **thought** that offering a $15 prize to all
comers would be a **good** way to get some market research done. What is wrong
with that thought? I wonder what the **quality** of their information will be.

>>

>> People are **rational actors** and will do exactly what is in their best
interests, as long as you define "best interests" really broadly. So you need
to be very thoughtful about the visible and not so visible incentives you put
out there because you will influence the outcome directly, and may have to
issue a **lot** of Starbucks gift cards!
