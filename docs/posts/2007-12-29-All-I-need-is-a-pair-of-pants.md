Ok, so what I find unbelievable and shocking about this paragraph is that
someone would try on over 150 pairs. Let's see, if trying on a pair takes
optimistically an average of 5 minutes, and she kept up this pace for 4 hours
per day, then our friend danah spent 3 days doing nothing **but trying on
pants.**

[I've known one other person who insisted that his first name not be
capitalized: glenn. Who knows…. But then my name is Pito.]
