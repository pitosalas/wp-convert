>> I couldn't **resist** , and so who knows why, we (Aleksey and I) have
**built a new product** in the BlogBridge family. We call it **BlogBridge:
Library**. It's a **software** application that customers can run on their own
servers which provides a nice, flexible, powerful library of RSS Feeds, OPML
Reading Lists and Podcasts. The idea is that the customer supplies the content
and gets the software from us. Kind of a **private iTunes Store** for Blogs,
Reading Lists and Podcasts.

>> It's targeted at any organization who **wants to create a library** of blog
and related information for a certain audience. We were **focused** on
companies or other organizations building a library for their employees or
users, inside their firewall. But **equally valid** is a library of feeds
running on a public site for a certain audience.
