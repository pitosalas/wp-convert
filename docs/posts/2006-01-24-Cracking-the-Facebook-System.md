>> So we've all heard about [Facebook](<http://www.facebook.com/>) but only
the ones of us who have a .edu email address can get an account. This was a
**source of envy** for me. **Nose** pressed against the **glass** , I wanted
to get **inside** to see what was going on. But of course I graduated college
and so, how to get a .edu address?

>>

>> **Simple**. Just call your College's **Alumni** department and generally
they will be glad to issue you a .edu email address with which you can (
**legitimately** ) become a Facebook member. Yes, its for college students and
**alumni too**!
