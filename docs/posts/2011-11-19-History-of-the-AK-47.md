# [History of the AK-47](None)




Not my usual topic, but I came across a rather [interesting article about the
history of the famous (infamous) AK-47 machine
gun.](<http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-worlds-most-popular-
gun>)

> "The AK-47 has succeeded so wildly because it is almost an ideal realization
> of the personal firearm: where most weapons have had to contend with
> tradeoffs between accuracy, lethality, speed of fire, reliability, cost of
> production, and ease of carrying and use, the AK-47 managed to find a sweet
> spot maximizing these traits. In fact, the weapon is so reliable, effective,
> and easy to use by untrained operators that its advent made it widely
> possible for just about any group, even with little money, modern
> technology, or formal military training, to mount significant, deadly
> assaults against a much larger and more advanced force â€” a fact that has
> transformed the face of warfare and created a revolutionary romance that
> still surrounds the weapon. (from [The New
