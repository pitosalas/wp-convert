![](https://i0.wp.com/www.baselinemag.com/images/stories/ArticleImages/BL_2008_03/TrafficChrt1.jpg?w=584)Check
out this very interesting [article that suggests that placing mesh network
nodes in cars is a far better way to implement congestion
pricing](<http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Chasing-Away-
Urban-Congestion/>) than what has been tried so far.

The short **paraphrase** is that you can place mesh network nodes in cars and
they can talk to an urban network to gain access and pay for access to the
cngestion pricing zone.

And, here's the **cool wrinkle** , in doing that also get an urban wifi
network 'for free'.

You have to [read the whole article](<http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Mobile-
and-Wireless/Chasing-Away-Urban-Congestion/>) to follow the chain of reasoning
but it's quite interesting.
