Just a quick note that we've updated the weekly build to 0.11. Given that we
are wrapping things up for our 1.0 Release, which is imminent, changes are
going to be mostly on internals - bug fixes and performance. Still there are a
few goodies here for you:

>>

>>   * Right clicking on an Article offers a "Copy Link to Clipboard" command.
There is a preference to cause the text on the clipboard to actually contain
the HREF notation to allow easy pasting into your blog.

>>   * For Mac users, we have tweaked the color scheme to be even more OS X
compliant.

>>   * Drag and Drop of shortcuts onto BlogBridge automatically try to
subscribe to them as a new Feed.

>>   * There are various other, even smaller items, not worth listing here.

>>

>> Enjoy!
