Here's my five-step plan for world domination:

1\. I am creating a **comprehensive taxonomy** of characteristics of
smartphone apps. Much more detailed than a feature list: "is it on android or
iPhone" but really micro. I will have 20 different user interface 'styles'
defined scientifically. I will analyze all 11 different variations on viral
growth models and describe them scientifically. I will classify the color
schemes, fonts used, left versur right swiping, number of customizable
characters, and that's just the start!

2\. Once I have that, I will have an **independent panel of experts score**
the top one hundred smart phone apps on each of the facets of my taxonomy.
With that I will have a 200-factor success "genome" for each of the top smart
phone apps.

3\. In parallel I will have a panel of **business researchers determine
statistics, over time,  **on each of the top smart phone apps. Number of
users, amount of revenue, number of downloads, user ratings, and most
important return on investment.

4\. Armed with that data I work with a top Statistics PhD and find the
**predictive factors that lead to a successful outcome for a proposed app.**

5\. Once I prove that my equation works, I will market my services to VCs and
app developers and help them **decide which horses to back, and how to improve
and refine the concepts they work on for maximum pay back.**

**What do you think? Will it work?**
