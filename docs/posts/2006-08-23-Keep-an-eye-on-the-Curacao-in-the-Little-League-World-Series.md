Curacao has in the past won or gotten very close to winning the overall Little
League World Series!

>> Oddly enough the way the overall World Series is structured is that the US
always makes it to the Semi Finals. Seems a bit rigged don't you think? At
least it's better than the big leagues where the "World" in "World Series"
means US and Canada ðŸ™‚
