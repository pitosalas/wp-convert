As I mentioned a few days ago, I went to see "The Gates" - [Environmental art
by Christo](<http://christojeanneclaude.net/tg.html>). My reaction: much
better and cooler than I thought it would be.

>> Not that there were any surprises - **it 's exactly what it was said to
be**: a whole bunch of orange (oops, sorry, safron) rectangular 'gates' all
over many of the paths and byways of Central Park in New York City.

>> But then you look around you, and in the distance, almost along the
horizon, more and _more gates, everywhere_. It evokes the feeling of being
part of a **huge parade** or **ceremony**.

>>

>> Surprisingly powerful.

>> #### What's the point of taking pictures?

>>

>> I had forgotten my camera and as I was walking around it occurred to me:
[Flikr! Check this out!](<http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/gates>) There are
over 4000 pictures, and that only under one tag.

>>

>> Other than perhaps a picture with Me in it, I don't think there's any
picture that I could have taken that is not already in [this
collection!](<http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/gates/show/>)
