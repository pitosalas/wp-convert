The problem with conferences is knowing what session to go to, right?

Check out this talk called "[ZOMG WHY IS MY CODE SO SLOW? Aaron
Patterson](<http://www.slideshare.net/tenderlove/zomg-why-is-this-code-so-
slow>). It's really excellent. It has many specific pointers that I will be
able to use as soon as I get back.

(Yes, in case you wonder:
[ZOMG](<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zomg>))
