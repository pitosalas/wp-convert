Reading this article about [The Casualties Of the NFL, in Men's
Journal](<http://www.mensjournal.com/feature/M162/M162_CasualtiesoftheNFL.html>)
the other week really colors my view of the NFL and football. Here's a bit of
it to give you a taste:

> "…But the men on the field who generate those billions are real; they bleed;
> they break; their brains cloud. The nature of their injuries, particularly
> the mind-dimming concussion, has dominated the off-the-field news of late.
> Post-mortem exams of Andre Waters (suicide at 44), Terry Long (suicide at
> 45), Justin Strzelczyk (car crash at 36), Mike Webster (heart attack at 50)
> -- showed staggering brain damage in men so young and affirmed that football
> is no longer a contact sport but real-life Mortal Kombat in cleats.
>
> Stunningly no one in the sport has stepped up to address the scope and depth
> of the injuries -- not the teams, not the owners, and certainly not the one
> organization charged with looking after the athletes, the NFL Players
> Association (NFLPA). In a game expected to take in $7 billion this year and
> that exceeds all others in causing bodily harm, fewer than 3 percent of the
> men who played in the league succeed in getting disability benefits. Worse,
> the players union turns away ailing vets despite a pension fund with $1
> billion in assets…." (from The Casualties of the NFL, Men's Journal)
