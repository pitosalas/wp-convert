# [Better to be a software developer than a college professor?](None)




Other than the headline, which is amusing, I am not sure about the methodology
or significance of this [study in US News (do they still
exist?)](<http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-
jobs>). And it seems that many professions, e.g. College Professor, don't even
get mentioned. Is it because they don't even make the top 100? I doubt it.
Anyway, Here's more about the US News and World Report's assessments:

> "All jobs aren’t created equal. In fact, some are simply better than the
> rest. U.S. News 100 Best Jobs of 2014 offer a mosaic of employment
> opportunity, good salary, manageable work-life balance and job security.
> Some careers offer just the right mix of these components – for instance,
> nearly 40 percent of our picks are health care jobs – but the list also
> includes strong showings from occupations in the social services and
> business sectors. And for the first time, our No. 1 pick is a technology
> job. Read more on how we rank the best jobs, and check out our complete
> list." Read the [whole article and see the report in US News and World
> Report.](<http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-
