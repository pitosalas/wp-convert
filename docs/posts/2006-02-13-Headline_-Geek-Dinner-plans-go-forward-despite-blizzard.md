Just a [quick reminder ](</weblogs/archives/001050.php>)of a Geek Dinner
organized by three of us: Adam Green, who writes [Darwinian
Web](<http://www.darwinianweb.com/>), Mark Doerschlag, and yours truly who
writes [this Blog](</>) and also runs the [BlogBridge
project](<http://www.blogbridge.com/>).  What is this "geek dinner" thing
again? Well we're **inviting all their geek friends** to hang out and geek out
for a few hours. Each of us have almost non-overlapping networks so this is a
chance for us to make new connections around town, and for you to do the same.
**Location** : [66 Church
Street](<http://maps.a9.com/?ypLoc=66%20church%20street%2C%20cambridge%2C%20ma>),
