**Link: [Collections](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/):** "We curate collections of images, books, audio and film, shining a light on curiosities and wonders from a wide range of online archives. Leaning toward the surprising, the strange, and the beautiful, we hope to provide an ever-growing cabinet of curiosities for the digital age" 

Very cool stuff. Inspiration for creative work.
