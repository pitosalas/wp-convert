[ Runno](< https://runno.dev/>) â€“It has some similarities with things like
JSFiddle or CodePen, but can run Ruby (as well as Python, C and C++). It can
even act interactively and accept user input (such as with gets). You can then
take these sandboxes and use them on your own pages/blog posts, etc.
