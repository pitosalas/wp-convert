**Link: [Great Read: Angels and Demons – Dan Brown](None):** ""

By sheer coincidence, the day before leaving for Spain, two people
independently mentioned to me that [Angels and Demons by Dan Brown
](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671027360/002-2245285-3016003?v=glance>)was
good, even better than [Da Vinci Code by the same
author](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209/002-2245285-3016003?v=glance>).
So, I picked up a copy at Barnes and Noble as my light reading for the trip.

>> This is a great, quick read. A page turner. **I recommend it.** And indeed
I agree that it was better and more interesting than Da Vinci Code.
Interesting as Angels and Demons is an earlier book, and still Da Vinci Code
is the one that is selling through the roof.

>> In today's New York Times, [there is an interesting article about
'Defenders of Christinanity' jumping in to 'rebut' the Da Vinci
Code](<http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/books/27CODE.html?hp?8hpib>). Maybe
I'm **dense** but when I read it, it didn't strike me as **attacking**
Christianity.
