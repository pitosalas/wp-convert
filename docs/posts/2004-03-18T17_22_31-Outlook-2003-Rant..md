>> **Outlook 2003 Rant.** What were those guys thinking? Don't get me wrong, I
am **not one of those Microsoft haters**. I love Microsoft. I admire their
work. But in this instance, and one that affects me directly and daily, boy do
**I feel let down**!

Program Manager who said, of the old 'Outlook Bar' - "we know it stinks; **we
are completely redesigning it! "** Yikes.
