I've seen several interviews with [Scott
Walker](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Walker_\(politician\)>), the
Governor of Wisconsin, about his efforts to 'balance the budget'. I put that
in scare quotes because there's a good case to be made that his agenda is
different or at least well beyond that.

He's very [articulate about his position, and quite
convincing](<http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/21/wisconsin.budget/index.html?iref=24hours>).
None of the interviewers had anything to add to the debate other than, "gee
aren't you union busting?" and "gee, how come isn't it good enough that the
unions have agreed to the financial concessions?" And the Governor has very
good answers to each of the obvious questions.

Along comes [David
Brooks](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/davidbrooks/index.html>),
as of now, my favorite op-ed columnist in the New York Times (sorry Tom
Friedman, you've been repeating yourself for a while now, and it gets tiresome
to see you constantly try to launch your own memes -- you've been replaced.)

[David Brooks adds something very interesting and new to the
debate](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/opinion/22brooks.html?_r=1&ref=davidbrooks>).
Basically his point is that not all unions are alike, and in fact, there's a
crucial and never discussed difference between public sector unions and
private sector unions:

> "[…snip…] **public sector unions and private sector unions are very
> different creatures**. Private sector unions push against the interests of
> shareholders and management; public sector unions push against the interests
> of taxpayers. Private sector union members know that their employers could
> go out of business, so they have an incentive to mitigate their demands;
> public sector union members work for state monopolies and have no such
> interest.
>
> Private sector unions confront managers who have an incentive to push back
> against their demands. Public sector unions face managers who have an
> incentive to give into them for the sake of their own survival. Most
> important, **public sector unions help choose those they negotiate with**.
> Through gigantic campaign contributions and overall clout, they have
> enormous influence over who gets elected to bargain with them, especially in
> state and local races.
>
> As a result of these **imbalanced incentive structures** , states with
> public sector unions tend to run into fiscal crises. They tend to have
> workplaces where personnel decisions are made on the basis of seniority, not
> merit. There is little relationship between excellence and reward, which
> leads to resentment among taxpayers who don’t have that luxury.[…snip…]" (
