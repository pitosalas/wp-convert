**Tortoise**  
by [Tim Mason](<http://www.timothydmason.com/tortoise.shtml>)

I set my pace deliberately  
keeping precious what matters  
under the hard shell  
I show the world.

Truth is  
survival counts  
each step I take assures that.

I'm not much on ambition,  
but how long you folks been around?

I put that question to Aesop  
when he was a betting lad –  
gave my bookie good odds against his rabbit  
I left him with a moral and a question  
“can you hang?”

Takes time to comprehend  
but patience comes with my pace  
so let me rephrase that  
how do you follow your dreams?

Me, I keep what's precious  
under the hard shell  
I show the world.
