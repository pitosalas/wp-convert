* **Web site excerpt:** Tutorials for MagniThis document discusses running our fiducial based navigation software on a Ubiquity Robotics robot base, using the supported Raspberry Pi camera. It also assumes that you have a workstation with ROS installed, which is connected to a network in common with the robot. You will need a printer, too.
