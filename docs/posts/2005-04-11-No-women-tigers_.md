# [No women tigers?](None)


![Tiger](https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/weblogs/images/tiger.jpg?resize=340%2C95)No
I am not talking about [Tiger Woods
](<http://www.tigerwoods.com/splash/splash.sps>)(who also is not a woman) but
about the "Engineers Who Created Tiger", [according to a recent bit of Apple
Marketing](<http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/index.html>). (Tiger is the name
of the new release of the Mac OS X operating system.) A odd image to portray,
IMHO.
