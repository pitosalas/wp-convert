(**Web site except:** Marc Andreeson is a somewhat legendry technologist. His advice may not fit you, but it is still worth listeneing to: "Some people argue that college will be your one chance in life to pursue your passion—to spend four years doing nothing but studying whatever you love the most, whether that’s Renaissance literature or existential philosophy.
