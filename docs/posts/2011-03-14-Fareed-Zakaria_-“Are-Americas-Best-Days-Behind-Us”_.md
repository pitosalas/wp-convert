**Link: [Fareed Zakaria: “Are Americas Best Days Behind Us”?](None):** ""

I know it's a **provocative title** , and sadly I suspect that many of the
'intended audience' will agree with much of what he says, but then also feel
like there's nothing that can be done about it.

I am a **waning fan** of the Sunday TV news shows. Nowadays it is so easy if
you are inclined to keep up with the news, moment by moment that it's hard to
find much more than the usual platitudes and repetition.

Fareed Zakaria's GPS program on Sundays for me is now easily the best. He has
interesting, thoughtful segments that don't fall into that boring greyness
that the rest of TV news has become. Nowadays, I only tune in to TV news for
the visuals.

So [Fareed Zakaria's new editorial in TIME
magazine](<http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html>)
tells us:

> "The following rankings come from various lists, but they all tell the same
> story.

> According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
> (OECD), our 15-year-olds rank 17th in the world in science and 25th in math.
> We rank 12th among developed countries in college graduation (down from No.
> 1 for decades). We come in 79th in elementary-school enrollment. Our
> infrastructure is ranked 23rd in the world, well behind that of every other
> major advanced economy. American health numbers are stunning for a rich
> country: based on studies by the OECD and the World Health Organization,
> we're 27th in life expectancy, 18th in diabetes and first in obesity. Only a
> few decades ago, the U.S. stood tall in such rankings. No more. There are
> some areas in which we are still clearly No. 1, but they're not ones we
> usually brag about. We have the most guns. We have the most crime among rich
> countries. And, of course, we have by far the largest amount of debt in the
> world." (**from** [Fareed
> Zakaria](<http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html>))

**Old news, right?** I have seen stats like this before, and they are
depressing. And yet any attempt to even talk about this is immediately shot
down.

Also depressing is that for all that they are 'common knowledge' it seems like
**our leaders are unable to get out of the mode that they are in:**

> "So why are we tackling our economic problems in a manner that is
> shortsighted and wrong-footed? Because it is **politically easy**. The key
> to understanding the moves by both parties is that, for the most part, they
> are targeting programs that have neither a wide base of support nor
> influential interest groups behind them. (And that's precisely why they're
> not where the money is. The American political system is actually quite
> efficient. It distributes the big bucks to popular programs and powerful
> special interests.)

> And neither side will even talk about tax increases, though it is impossible
> to achieve long-term fiscal stability without them. Certain taxes — such as
> ones on carbon or gas — would have huge benefits beyond revenue, like energy
> efficiency." (from [Fareed
> Zakaria](<http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html>))

because:

> Any politician who dares suggest that the U.S. can learn from — let alone
> copy — other countries is likely to be denounced instantly.

> If someone points out that Europe gets better health care at half the cost,
> that's dangerously socialist thinking.

> If a business leader notes that tax rates in much of the industrialized
> world are lower and that there are far fewer loopholes than in the U.S., he
> is brushed aside as trying to impoverish American workers. If a commentator
> says — correctly — that social mobility from one generation to the next is
> greater in many European nations than in the U.S., he is laughed at.

> Yet several studies, the most recent from the OECD last year, have found
> that the average American has a much lower chance of moving out of his
> parents' income bracket than do people in places like Denmark, Sweden,
> Germany and Canada. (from [Fareed
> Zakaria](<http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html>))

I probably will be branded as a socialist just for liking this article.
