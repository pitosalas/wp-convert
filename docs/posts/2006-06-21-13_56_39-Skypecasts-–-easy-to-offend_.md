>> I just discovered
[Skypecasts](<https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/home>). Cool new (free!)
service. I haven't tried it yet but it seems like an obvious way to continue
getting the word out on [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com/>) and
[BlogBridge:Library](<http://www.blogbridge.com/archive.php?a=product/bb_library>).

>>

>> Funny thing happened to me though. I used the Skypecast interface to
schedule my very own
[Skypecast](<https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=11644>).
I called it "[BlogBridge:Library
discussion](<https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=11644>)",
and the description was:

>>

>>> "For people interested in learning more about our new product,
BlogBridge:Library, CEO and designer Pito Salas will host a totally informal
Q&A."

>>

>> [Skype](<http://www.skype.com/helloagain.html>) refused to schedule my
[Skypecast](<https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=11644>),
giving this **error message** :

>>

>>> _" The description contains words which may be considered offensive.
Please rephrase the description below."_ _

>>>

>>> _

>>

>> I tuned and tuned the description and could not get it accepted. And then I
**removed** my **OWN NAME**! "Pito" heh. It turns out -- and of course many
have pointed this out over the years -- that pito is let's say an [impolite
word](<http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pito>) in certain
languages.

>>

>> I had to remove my own name from the description of the
[Skypecast](<https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=11644>).
And then all was well.

>>

>> What if my name was " **Dick** "?
