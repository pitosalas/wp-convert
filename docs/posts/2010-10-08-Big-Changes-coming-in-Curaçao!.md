You may not follow the news, but Curaçao is undergoing major constitutional
changes, as are all the Netherlands Antilles. In fact, as of this Sunday, Oct
10, ("10-10-10") the Netherlands Antilles will cease to exist as a legal
entity.

The easiest way to explain this to Americans that I have come up with is, that
it's as if all the islands of the State of Hawaii decided that they should all
be their own state, the state of Oahu, of Maui, etc.

This is from an article in the BBC Caribean:

> "A series of negotiations, with Holland in the role of part partner/part
> arbiter, resulted in an agreement in which Curacao and St Maarten will
> become ‘separate countries’ with direct ties to Holland.
>
> The three smaller islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba, (the BES
> islands) will be incorporated administratively into existing Dutch provinces
> in Holland." (from [10-10-10: Why It
> Matters](<http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2010/10/101006_10-10-10.shtml>))

Much to my surprise, no one can find a t-shirt commemorating this big day, so
with my new found graphic design swagger, I decided to design my own. [Get
