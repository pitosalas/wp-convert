>> Chorus:

>>

>> Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight

>>

>> Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene

>>

>> I'll see you in my dreams

>>

>> Last Saturday night I got married

>>

>> Me and my wife settled down

>>

>> Now me and my wife are parted

>>

>> Gonna take another stroll downtown

>>

>> Sometimes I live in the country

>>

>> Sometimes I live in the town

>>

>> Sometimes I get a great notion

>>

>> To jump in the river and drown

>>

>> Well I asked your mother for you

>>

>> She told me you was too young

>>

>> I wish to the Lord I'd never seen your face

>>

>> Or heard your lying tongue

>>

>> Stop your rambling, stop your gambling

>>

>> Stop staying out late at night

>>

>> Go home to your wife and your family

>>

>> Stay home by the fireside bright

>>

>> I love Irene God knows I do

>>

>> Love her to the day I die

>>

>> If Irene turns her back on me

>>

>> I'll take morphine and die

>>

>> (If you know why I posted this then you know why I posted this 🙂
