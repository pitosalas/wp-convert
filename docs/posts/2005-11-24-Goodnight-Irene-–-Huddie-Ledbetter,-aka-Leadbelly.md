Chorus: Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene I'll
see you in my dreams Last Saturday night I got married Me and my wife settled
down Now me and my wife are parted Gonna take another stroll downtown
Sometimes I live in the country Sometimes I live in the town Sometimes I get a
great notion To jump in the river and drown Well I asked your mother for you
She told me you was too young I wish to the Lord I'd never seen your face Or
heard your lying tongue Stop your rambling, stop your gambling Stop staying
out late at night Go home to your wife and your family Stay home by the
fireside bright I love Irene God knows I do Love her to the day I die If Irene
turns her back on me I'll take morphine and die (If you know why I posted this
then you know why I posted this ðŸ™‚ Technorati Tags:
