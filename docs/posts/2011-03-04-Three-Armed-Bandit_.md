If I could fool you into believing that a fake rubber hand that you were
looking at was really your own hand, how would you react if I took a knife to
it? Weird questions that Neuro-science researchers busy themselves with, but
really fairly amazing. [Here's an article in Scientific American about the

hand-researchers-conv-2011-02-23>)

> "A knife-wielding researcher is bearing down on your right handâ€”or is it
