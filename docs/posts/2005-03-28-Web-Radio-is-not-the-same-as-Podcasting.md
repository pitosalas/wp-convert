>>> "Thousands of others share a similar affliction, thanks to Internet
technology that lets anybody with a little money set up an online "radio
station." The term isn't quite right, since the Internet uses wires, not radio
waves, to transmit music and chat. But Internet broadcasting has grown in
popularity to the point where it's become a significant alternative to
traditional radio, and an appealing venue for major advertisers."
