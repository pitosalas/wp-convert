[I came across a fascinating article,
](<http://www.patternlanguage.com/archive/ieee/ieeetext.htm>)a transcript of a
speech by **Christopher Alexander** , architect and author of "A Pattern
Language."

>>

>> Alexander is the guy who invented **Patterns** as they have now been
broadly adopted by the Software Design community. In this piece Alexander
tells of the thinking and **objectives that led to the Pattern approach** to
architectural design - much more than simply cataloging patterns that were
known work. He was hoping that when architects used these patterns they would
be **led, driven, forced** into creating living and livable structures.

>>

>> In his words:

>>

>>> "However, that is not all that pattern languages are supposed to do. The
pattern language that we began creating in the 1970s had other essential
features. First, it has a **moral component**. Second, it has the aim of
creating coherence, morphological coherence in the things which are made with
it. And third, it is generative: it allows people to create coherence, morally
sound objects, and encourages and enables this process because of its emphasis
on the coherence of the created whole.

>>>

>>> I don't know whether these features of pattern language have yet been
translated into your discipline. "

read.](<http://www.patternlanguage.com/archive/ieee/ieeetext.htm>)**
