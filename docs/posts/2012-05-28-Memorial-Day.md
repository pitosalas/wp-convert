_" It is impossible to be unmoved by the juxtaposition of the eternal stone-
faced warrior and the disheveled modern military wife-turned-widow, him rigid
in his dress uniform, her on the floor in her blanket nest, wearing glasses
and a baggy T-shirt, him nearly concealed by shadow while the pale blue light
from the computer screen illuminates her like God’s own grace." (from [At War
