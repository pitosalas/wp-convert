The other day, [Amazon released a free application on the iPhone (and iPod
Touch.) On the surface, just another ebook application.

The application is free. When you run it the first thing you do is to register
it to Amazon's web site (using your normal Amazon username and password - you
already have one, right?)  As far as the Amazon site goes, your iPhone is a
Kindle. It shows up on your list of Kindles. And you can buy books for it. So
now you can visit the [Kindle Store](<http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-
Wireless-Reading-
Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/ref=amb_link_83607871_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=1YP113BP56SN3V5NAENM&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=469527991&pf_rd_i=133141011>)
on Amazon and buy books (and free book samples)

Now on my iPhone, magically, those books appear on my book list, and I can
read them. There's a huge collection of books and particularly nice, free
initial chapters for a ton of books.

Here's the **genius** part: I get a free app, experience the [Amazon Kindle
Store](<http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-
blogs/b/ref=topnav_storetab_kinc?ie=UTF8&node=133141011>), get a bunch of free
books and read them on my iPhone. The iPhone is a crappy ebook reader. The
screen is too small: Solution: **I guess I need a Kindle.** Genius.
