**(Demo 2004 Series - 3) **By my informal survey, this was the **favorite** at
demo. XKey is a tiny USB port device (kind of like one of those little USB
flash devices) which, by plugging into a laptop, **transforms the host
computer into a private, isolated, separate computer, connected by VPN to the
corporate network.**

>> It's hard to explain in a few words, but basically you plug it into the USB
port while your computer is connected to your corporate LAN. Magically files,
folders, exchange and outlook data, are all copied onto the device. When you
take it and plug it into another ('host') computer, you get access to all your
work, plus your Exchange/Outlook information. All the information is secured
inside a 'sandbox' and you are protected from and prohibited from letting any
of it leak onto the 'host' computer. As I said, hard to explain. Look at their
web site for more details.

>> The **really clever thing** here is to take a **bit of raw technology** (a
portable, USB storage device) to something that **solves a real, believable,
pain point**. Their product is clearly **targeted** at businesses who want to
allow employees to securely use their corporate assets away from the office.

>> Among Demo attendees this one was often cited as the **most interesting
product** demoed. And credit to Chris  Shipley, she must have seen that,
because it was also the very first product to be demoed.
