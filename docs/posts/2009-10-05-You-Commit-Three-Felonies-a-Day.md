# [You Commit Three Felonies a Day](None)




[Interesting
commentary](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704471504574438900830760842.html>)
on a new book by Harvey Silvergate called "Three Felonies a Day". The article
also touches on the notion that "Under the English common law that we
inherited, a crime requires intent.", saying:

> "Sometimes legislators know when they make false distinctions based on
> technology. An "anti-cyberbullying" proposal is making its way through
> Congress, prompted by the tragic case of a 13-year-old girl driven to
> suicide by the mother of a neighbor posing as a teenage boy and posting
> abusive messages on MySpace. The law would prohibit using the Internet to
> "coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a
> person." Imagine a law that tried to apply this control of speech to
> letters, editorials or lobbying" ( **from** [Wall Street
> Journal](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704471504574438900830760842.html>))
