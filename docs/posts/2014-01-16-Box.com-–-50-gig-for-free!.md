**Forget Dropbox** , I just heard that Box.com gives you **50gig for free**
upon signup. I just signed up and it seems like I got it. Pretty cool:

[Box | Secure content-sharing that users and IT love and
adopt](<https://app.box.com/home/>):

> Box lets you store all of your content online, so you can access, manage and
> share it from anywhere. Integrate Box with Google Apps and Salesforce and
> access Box on mobile devices. Learn More

But I wonder: **how can they do it?** Is storage so cheap now? Yahoo gives
100Gig free with Flickr.com.

And I also wonder, **who needs 50gig** free for non commercial use on Box.com?
My first idea was to fill it up with movies, tv shows and so on.

But then I got to thinking: what if box.com is a big front, a magnet, or
honeypot if you will, for pirated content? What if the entertainment industry,
or even the FBI was behind it? Not that I myself have any such pirated stuff,
but I hear that the FBI spends a lot of time trying to track down and shut
down such sites.

What do you think?
