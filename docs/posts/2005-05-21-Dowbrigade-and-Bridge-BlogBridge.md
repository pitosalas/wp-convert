Just a quick note of the **very nice** mention of BlogBridge by almost-famous
[Dowbrigade](<http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dowbrigade/>) blog by the
incredibly prolific Michael Feldman.

>>> (Emphasis mine, throughout)  Blog Bridge is the amazing new RSS reader and
aggregator from Pito Salas. Sure, it makes it **easy** to subscribe, arrange,
view and blog from anything with an RSS feed. **But what really sets it
apart** is that it is written completely in **Java** , which means that it is
platform-independent, works on any computer connected to the interenet, and it
remembers not only what you are subscribed to, but which articles you have
already read, or saved, or filed to read later. From anywhere, on any machine.
Being used to the much simpler aggregator built into Manila, it took us a
while to discover the utility of moving feeds into channels and groups, but
now it seems **second nature**.  There are suggested sample groupings to get
beginners started, pre-packaged packets of feeds, which you can easily modify
by adding and dropping feeds. (from
