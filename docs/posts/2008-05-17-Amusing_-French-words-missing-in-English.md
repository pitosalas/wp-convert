"No language is perfect, and English is no exception. There are always words
or expressions that cannot be rendered from one language to another. English
supposedly has the largest vocabulary of any languages in the world (7x more
words than French !), and well-educated people typically know less than 10% of
them. There would be too many English words and nuances that do not exist in
other languages (thousands in French, Italian or Japanese), but much less the
other way round. Here are examples of the occasional French words that do not
have an exact translation in English, or not in a single word."
