**Link: [RFC processes are a poor fit for most organizations - Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://jacobian.org/2023/dec/1/against-rfcs/):** "The RFC process has been a huge success in defining the standards that run the Internet, but naively adopting this process for your company is a mistake. RFC processes tend to fail at most organizations because they lack a clear decision-making step."

How to make decisions in an organization. Or more like how not to make decisions in organizations.
