# [Maybe I hate my iPhone](None)




[This is from today's New York Times
Magazine](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/magazine/05wwln-

Heffernan](<http://themedium.blogs.nytimes.com/>) was funny!

I actually don't have an iPhone although I've been seriously considering
getting one when the next generation comes out in June. Why have I waited so
long? I worry that the reality won't live up to the anticipation, and that I
might grow, over time, to hate my iPhone or what it does to me.
