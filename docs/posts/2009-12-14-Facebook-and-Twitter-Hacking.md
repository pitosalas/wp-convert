I guess it's not surprising that people's [Facebook and twitter accounts are
getting
compromised](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/technology/internet/14virus.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper>).
From the New York Times:

> "Malicious programs are rampaging through Web sites like
> [Facebook](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-
> org> "More articles about Facebook.") and
> [Twitter](<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/twitter/index.html?inline=nyt-
> org> "More articles about Twitter."), spreading themselves by taking over
> peopleâ€™s accounts and sending out messages to all of their friends and
> followers. The result is that people are inadvertently telling their co-
> workers and loved ones how to raise their I.Q.â€™s or make money instantly, or
> urging them to watch an awesome new video in which they star." ( **from**

I just changed my three Twitter accounts, and Facebook accounts to use a "very
hard" password. I suggest you consider doing it too ðŸ™‚
