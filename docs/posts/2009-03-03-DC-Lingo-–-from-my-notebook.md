**Link: [DC Lingo – from my notebook](None):** ""

More stuff that I learned at [Transparency
camp](<http://www.transparencycamp.org/>).

Every city has their own way of talking. In New York, I guess you talk about
wall street and finance and so on. In L.A. you talk about movies and
moviestars. In D.C. you talk about all things politics. (In Boston you talk
about the Red Sox 🙂

The President's limousine, is known as "**The Beast** "

You've heard the expression: "It's easier to apologize than to ask
permission." In DC it's "**Proceed until apprehended**."

You mark yourself as an out-of-towner if you don't know what **CQ** stands
for.
