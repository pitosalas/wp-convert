>> Boy, blogs sure are **hot** , aren't they? I've been noticing the New York
Times regularly quoting bloggers as legitimate sources side by side with
witnesses, experts, politicians. And now the [Boston Globe has a
bit](<http://bostonworks.boston.com/news/articles/2006/04/16/blogs_essential_to_a_good_career/>)
about blogging your way to a job:

>>

>>> "Blogging is good for your career. A well-executed blog sets you apart as
an expert in your field."

>>>

>>> […] But pick your topics carefully and have a purpose. "The most
interesting blogs are focused and have a certain attitude," says van Allen.
"You need to have a guiding philosophy that you stick to. You cannot one
minute pontificate on large issues of the world and the next minute be like,
'My dog died.' "

>>>

>>> […] Day realized the value of focus after a misguided mashup of his
politics and business. ( **from** [The Boston
Globe](<http://bostonworks.boston.com/news/articles/2006/04/16/blogs_essential_to_a_good_career/>))

>>

>> Of course the blog that you are reading right now is just such a mashup of
random topics that interest me. That's probably why my **experimentation**
with putting ads so far **has yielded next to nothing**. But I am
experimenting as much to learn how ads on web pages do and don't work as much
as anything.
