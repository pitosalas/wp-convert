My new cellphone **supposedly** has GPS capabilities. It has to do, apparently
with the new [E-911](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_911>) standard,
which requires a cell phone to be able to tell emergency responders where a
cell call is coming from. I'm a pretty big GPS aficionado and I thought GPSs
had to have these **big** ugly antennas, **complex** expensive circuitry, and
**lots** of software. I don't understand how all that stuff can be crammed
into a tiny little phone. So I got to thinking that they were just using the
term 'GPS' **loosely** , and that instead what was going on is a much more
**simplistic** triangulation between cell towers which, I suppose could
produce a rough location reading. Apparently I was **wrong**! Now, here come
Sprint and [Garmin](<https://mobile.garmin.com/obn/learnMore.jsp>), with a
turn-by-turn navigation application that runs on my new phone. [It looks
pretty cool!](<https://mobile.garmin.com/obn/demo.jsp>) What a **rip-off** :
$9.99 per month! I **can 't wait** to try it 🙂 Technorati Tags:
