**Link: [VSCode + WSL makes Windows awesome for web development](https://world.hey.com/dhh/vscode-wsl-makes-windows-awesome-for-web-development-9bc4d528):** "I’m kinda shocked. Windows actually got good for web developers.

That’s just taste. But, the so called disadvantage of the macOS “walled garden” to me is a feature. That my contacts, calendar, desktop, email and all seamlessly stay in sync across my laptops, desktop, phone and tablet is a huge advantage that I totally rely on.
