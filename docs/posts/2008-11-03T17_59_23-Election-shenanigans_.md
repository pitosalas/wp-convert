I am **not at all sure** what to make of this. But a friend of mine pointed me
to some of the following postings and reports which are interesting, and if
true, **highly disturbing**.

  * Attorney [Cliff Arnebeck](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Arnebeck>) on how the [Ohio Election was/might have been stolen](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv4kRG9ne_g>)

  * Security expert Stephen Spoonamore's [personal legal affidavit on the technical architecture that might have been used to achieve this](<http://www.velvetrevolution.us/images/Filed%20ExhG%20Spoon%20Decl%20Oct.pdf>)

  * Cliff Arnebeck about his [personal experience with election irregularities in Ohio](<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P49mAc-du3I>)

If you want to know more, just google for [Stephen
Spoonamore](<http://www.google.com/search?q=stephen+Spoonamore&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
