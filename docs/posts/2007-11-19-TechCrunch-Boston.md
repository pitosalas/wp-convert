Two nights ago, Friday, I got to go to the **[TechCrunch Boston
party](<http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/16/highlights-for-tonights-
techcrunch-meetup-in-boston/>)** at The Estate in Boston (which oddly enough
doesn't seem to have a web site.) Those of you **who know me** will be
'surprised' that **I had to miss** the 'drinking-focused after party, held at
an Irish pub, from 11:00pm on.

Lately it seems like every week there's another tech networking event in our
area, which is great. This one was huge though, seemed like 500 or more
people, elbow to elbow. **Great fun!**

Here's [Don Dodge's write up on his experience at the TechCrunch Boston
event](<http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/11/techcrunch-
bost.html>). Don's a very diligent blogger as you can see from the post. Said
Don:

> Big Thing, Don Dodge's
> Blog](<http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/11/techcrunch-
> bost.html>))

Now a couple of things, Don: I don't know how anyone can talk to over 200
people in one evening, especially if you aren't counting the winks and nods.
And by the way, what's all this winking you're doing anyway? 🙂
