I recently subscribed to the New York Review of Books. Not sure this was a
good decision as the last thing I need is more stuff to read. I came to it
because I kept seeing interesting articles from the NYRB come up on various
blogs and searches.

Here's quite an [interesting book
review](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098?ie=UTF8&assoc_ss_swlb=1&creativeASIN=0199812098&redirect=true>)
of "[Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and
Naturalism](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0199812098&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0199812098) ". This sets the tone:

> "One of the things atheists tend to believe is that modern science is on
> their side, whereas theism is in conflict with science: that, for example,
> belief in miracles is inconsistent with the scientific conception of natural
> law; faith as a basis of belief is inconsistent with the scientific
> conception of knowledge; belief that God created man in his own image is
> inconsistent with scientific explanations provided by the theory of
> evolution. In his absorbing new book, [Where the Conflict Really Lies:
> Science, Religion, and
> Naturalism](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0199812098&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://www.assoc-

> opposition on its head. His overall claim is that “there is superficial
> conflict but deep concord between science and theistic religion, but
> superficial concord and deep conflict between science and naturalism.” By

> anything like God." (from [New York Review of
