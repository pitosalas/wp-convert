A really excellent [interview/review of Christopher Hitchens and his memoir,
"Hitch-22":](<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8388695/Godless-in-
Tumourville-Christopher-Hitchens-interview.html>)

> "He could never have guessed how prescient those words would be. In June
> last year, while on a tour of America to promote the hardback publication of
> his book, Hitchens was taken ill in New York and was subsequently diagnosed
> with cancer of the oesophagus. Thus did he acquire his visa to a place where
> nothing can be taken for granted. Hitchens has christened it 'Tumourville’."
