A good [article in the Atlantic about game designer Jonathan
Blow](<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-
gamer/8928/>). Interesting quote:

> "I continued. “You’ve been chasing some deep form of understanding all your
> life, and what I think you’ve found is that questing after that knowledge
> brings alienation with it.
>
> The further you’ve gone down that road, the further it’s taken you from
> other people. So the knowledge is ultimately destructive to your life, just
> like the atom bomb was—it’s a kind of truth that has a cataclysmic impact.
>
> You thought chasing that knowledge would make you happy, but like Tim, part
> of you eventually wished you could turn back time and do things over again.”

And read this thought provoking way to represent a fourth spacial dimension
visually. I don't know whether it works but the description makes it sound
quite amazing:

> "Well,” ten Bosch countered, “this is what it would be like if there were.”
> And that was about the last thing he said that I understood for quite a
> while, as he and Blow chatted avidly about extruding surfaces and imagining
> flat planes as tubes.
>
> In  _Miegakure_ , two spatial dimensions are constant, and the player solves
> puzzles by swapping between the two others with the press of a button.

If you read the comment thread on the article you see that this guy (Blow)
elicits a lot of negativity because supposedly his games aren't actually that
good, and he's so full of himself. I haven't looked at the games so I can just
go by what the article says, but I liked what I read!
