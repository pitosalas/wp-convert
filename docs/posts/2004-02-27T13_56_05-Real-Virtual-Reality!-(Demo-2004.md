>> **Real Virtual Reality! (Demo 2004 Series - 6)** I am not clear as to
whether [Total Immersion](<http://www.t-immersion.com/>) is a product,
company, research product or what. But they had the most compelling and
memorable technology demonstration. It was an amazing virtual reality
experience of what they called  **“augmented reality. "**

>> Basically what we saw was a video and audio display in real time. The
camera started on the presenter as he was talking. In his hand was a long
stemmed rose. Except in real life, he was holding his left hand in a fist, and
the flower was added virtually. Every move, translation, rotation etc of his
fist was perfectly matched with the movement of the rose creating a **perfect
illusion**. And there was a lot more. The demo ended with a virtual helicopter
flying over the heads of the audience. **Very impressive**!

>> Of course one is always more impressed with technologies which appear to be
**' magic'** to the viewer. In this case, I know very little about VR and I am
blown away. I can't say if one **' versed in the art'** would have thought the
same or been bored.
