I saw this movie last night and really thought it was great. I had read some[
negative commentary about Zero Dark
Thirty](<http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/feb/07/disturbing-
misleading-zero-dark-thirty/?pagination=false>):

> "At the same time, a number of journalists and public officials—including
> three United States senators—have excoriated Zero Dark Thirty. Their main
> complaint is that the film greatly overstates the role played by torture—or
> “enhanced interrogation techniques,” in the CIA’s terrifying euphemism—in
> extracting from al-Qaeda-affiliated detainees information that ultimately
> led to the discovery of Osama bin Laden’s hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan,
> where he was killed by Navy SEALs on May 2, 2011." (from [New York Review of
> Books](<http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/feb/07/disturbing-

With the benefit of having seen the movie, I feel this **critique** , like the
whole article, is quite **overwrought**.

You have to be a **very observant** movie watcher (catching the many
unfamiliar names that are rattled off) to truly have an impression that
torture played a **key role** in the information that led to USM's demise.

Also you have to have **missed** TV shows like '**24** ' and '**Homeland** '
to be overly shocked by the depictions of torture. There was no blood, and the
hitting was quite mild really.

[spoiler alert] I mean an interrogation scene in Homeland this last season had
the interrogator very suddenly and unexpectedly pull out a knife and stick it
hard into the victims hand as the hands were flat on a table. That was
shocking!

See the movie. It's really **interesting** while being a **edge-of-your-seat**
story.
