(**Web site except:** John Cleese (Monty Python) nails it in this classic 1976 work “Meetings, Bloody Meetings”, and his hilarious portrayal of meeting culture seems worryingly accurate today.

That's why we created MetaMeet. MetaMeet is a workplace app that helps employees reduce time spent in meetings: https://metameetapp.com/

Help us on our mission to stop the meeting madness!
