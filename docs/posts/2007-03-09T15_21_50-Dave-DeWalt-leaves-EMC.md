I guess that many of you who read this blog are eRoom, Documentum and EMC
alums so you'd be interested in reading what [John Newton, co-founder of
Documentum has to say about the departure of Dave DeWalt from
EMC](<http://newton.typepad.com/content/2007/03/the_departed_da.html>):

> "[snipâ€¦] Being a co-founder of [Documentum](<http://www.documentum.com/>)
> prior to starting [Alfresco](<http://www.alfresco.com/>), it is only natural
> that people are asking me what I think of [Dave DeWaltâ€™s departure from
> EMC](<http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197800441>)
> to become CEO at Security Software firm McAfee [snipâ€¦]" from Content Log.

As a humerous aside, I've heard from more than one person that this silly blog
of mine is blocked inside of EMC! Can you believe it? The lunkheads in IT have
classified it as porn. Maybe it was because of [this post that I aptly titled
"balls"](</2004/06/12/balls/>)? It just shows that whatever you write on the
internet will follow you around for life ðŸ™‚ Oh, it's the #1 Google hit if you
search for ["Balls Pito
Salas"](<http://www.google.com/search?q=balls+pito+salas&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
