I am not going to write yet another long review or commentary. But I can't
resist a few crass words:

  * It's real and it works. They had 4 of them in stock at my neighborhood ATT/Cingular shop. It is indeed gorgeous. Sleek, star-trekky. It does everything you see in the ads (and I am sure, much much more.)

  * I don't want one ('yet' - never say never). It's a little to precious for my taste. Kind of reminds me of how I feel about $3,000 Bang & Olufson stereo gear. Beautiful for a museum but not for me.

Ok, but was it easy to use? Given that they've kind of invented a new paradigm
for interacting with a computer, it's darn impressive. All that functionality,
yet no menus.

I have to say though that the on-screen (glass) keyboard was not magic for me.
I had to do plenty of retyping. Ok so the magic that I was made to expect from
the previews didn't happen.

But we forget what we have come to put up with when doing text entry on a
little cell phone. This is at least as good, probably a lot better.
