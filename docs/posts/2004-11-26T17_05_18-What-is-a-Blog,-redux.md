>> I just [came across a good
summary](<http://www.portalsmag.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=6159>) on
one of our favorite topics from KM Magazine. It was written by [Bill Ives of
Portals and KM fame:](<http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/>)

>>> _" Blogs are both a technology and a way of communicating. On the one
hand, they are nothing more than simple Web sites, often published in the form
of a journal, that provide original content, links to other relevant content,
simple editing features, comment capability, archiving, search, and security
options. This ease of use provides a vehicle for the writer's unedited
personal voice, which is considered a defining aspect of blogs. While many
uses beyond personal journalism have emerged, the individual voice remains a
central characteristic, even in the corporate setting."_
