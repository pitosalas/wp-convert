**Link: [The new, now cancelled, Jay Leno Show](None):** ""

Finally I found someone expressing what I have been thinking about [the fracas
about NBC, Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien](<http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/01/18/jay-
leno-and-the-missed-opportunity/>) etc. etc. And while I didn't know then what
I know now, I did eagerly tune in for the first Jay Leno @ 10:00pm show,
hoping to see the payoff to all the hype that preceded that first episode. Do
you remember all the promos and the hints and speculation? Then, on that first
night:

> "What would Jerry Seinfeld -- Jay's good buddy -- do with five hours of

> Bruckheimer or Nigel Lythgoe? You think they would have simply recycled old

> mold." (from [TV Squad](<http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/01/18/jay-leno-and-the-
> missed-opportunity/>))

True, true. I think Jay Leno in the end is the reason why he didn't do well at
10:00, not NBC, not Conan, not 'life the universe an everything." Sorry Jay -
I used to be a fan.
