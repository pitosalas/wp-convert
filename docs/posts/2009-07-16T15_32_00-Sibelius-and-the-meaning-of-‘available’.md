title: "Sibelius and the meaning of ‘available’"

There aren't many good options for Music notation software.
[Sibelius](<http://www.sibelius.com/home/index_flash.html>) is in my opinion
the best, which as this software goes is not saying all that much. For it's
functionality it's quite good, as a piece of elegant and usable software, it
gets a "B" at best.

Over a month ago Sibelius [announced their Version
6](<http://www.sibelius.com/products/sibelius/6/index.html>). Like any
software company they made a much bigger deal of it than the changes would
justify. Still there were a few things in it that I wanted.

They started taking orders over a month ago. They have a **not very generous**
deal for upgraders (I already have version 5) but still I decided to order it.

**A month later,** Version 6 is still on ' **backorder** ' whatever that
means. I asked the rep I just spoke to **what they mean when they say that it
's 'available**' (Yes I admit I was being a pain in the ass and that she is in
no way at fault.).

She said, it means that you can order it.

I couldn't resist pointing out that for me, **available should also mean**
that once I order, they actually **have something to ship**.

Makes you wonder **what 's going on behind the scenes**. Was it pre-announced
to freeze out the competition? Was it pre-announced to please their stock
holders? Did they experience some late in the game software development
crisis?
