>> **Echo Chamber, redux:** Are we **wasting** our **valuable** brain cells
**duplicating** each other's work? There was an excellent and thought

[David Weinberger](<http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002418.html>),
[Joi Ito](<http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/02/11/technorati_talk.html>), [Doc
Searls](<http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/02/10#technoratification>), [Dan
Gillmor](<http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001773.shtml#001773>),
and I am **sure there were others**.

computing the BQ (Blog Quotient) for meatspace events, the proportion of an
audience which is blogging. As it approaches **one** , you have to **wonder**.

>> Yes, I guess we get **different** **perspectives** of the same event, but
is there enough attention in the universe to **pay**?
