Just a few handy links that, if you are a Rails developer you may be
interested in:

  * [Ruby Plus - Free Ruby and Rails Screencasts](<http://www.rubyplus.org/>)
  * [RailsCasts - free Ruby on Rails screencasts](<http://railscasts.com/>)
  * [ActiveScaffold - A RoR plugin that magically and dynamically creates user interfaces](<http://activescaffold.com/>)
  * [PeepCode - A super valuable collection of in-depth Screencast, worth every one of the 900 pennies each costs](<http://peepcode.com/>)

I have found each of these a great resource, and I recommend them to you!
