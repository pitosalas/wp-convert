Check out this [cool site developed](<http://definitious.com>) by some
Brandeis students who participated in the [bootcamp-like
course](<http://www.brandeis.edu/jbs/r2010programs/websservices/index.html>)
that I taught this summer. It's called [Definitious](<http://definitious.com>)
and it's kind of a collaborative, semi-serious, semi-silly dictionary where
anyone can define any word they want and others can vote the definitions up
and down. [Definitious](<http://definitious.com>).

By the way, we are in already [planning an expanded
version](<http://www.brandeis.edu/jbs/r2011programs/mobileapps/index.html>) of
the course for this coming summer. It's going to be even better!
