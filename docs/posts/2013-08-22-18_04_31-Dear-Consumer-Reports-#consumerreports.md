The way you try to get me to renew my subscription is just as bad as many of
the merchants you call out in your reviews.

It is August. I have now received 3 mailings saying things like "It's almost
too late" and "*** THIRD NOTICE***" reminding me to renew my subscription.

My subscription doesn't expire until December 2013, 4 months from now. We are
barely half way through the subcription period.

**LEAVE ME ALONE** please.

You are setting a horrible example.
