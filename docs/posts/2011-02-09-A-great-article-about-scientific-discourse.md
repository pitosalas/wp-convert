**Link: [A great article about scientific discourse](None):** ""



This article is called ["Fact and Folklore In Software Engineering"
](<http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html>) and while it is about that, the
part that was more interesting to me was the first section talking about
Scientific Discourse:

> "This article is about why some “facts” refuse to die, and about how to
> avoid being fooled by opinion disguised as scientific “fact”. We start,
> therefore, with some observations on science and facts." ( **from** ["Fact
> and Folklore In Software
> Engineering"](<http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html>))

Here he goes on to describe "The messy workings of scientific discourse". It's
clarifying explanation of a process that we understand intuitively but
actually has a rigorous process:

> "Bruno Latour is one of the keenest observers I know of the work that
> scientists really do, and one of the most punctilious in clearing away the
> myths and misconceptions about how science is in fact done. I have found
> good use in some of the tools he created to assess the status of an
> _ongoing_ debate about a matter that falls within the purview of science,
> one that hasn’t been settled - what he calls a
> [controversy](<http://www.demoscience.org/>)." ( **from** ["Fact and
> Folklore In Software
> Engineering"](<http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html>))

After lots of further interesting detail about this idea, he finally comes
back to the question: "So what is known about programmer productivity?":

> "We can now circle back to this widely circulated “fact” of the software
> profession, according to which “programmer productivity varies by a factor
> of 10 (or 5, or 20) between the best and worst individuals”. This is a
> remarkable statement, not least because of its implications: for instance,
> programmer compensation does not vary accordingly." ( **from** ["Fact and
> Folklore In Software
> Engineering"](<http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html>))

After this introduction he goes on to thoroughly take apart this concept as
nothing more than unsubstantiated, oft-repeated folklore, based in some really
old, actually inapplicable, and incorrectly cited studies.

But they stick because there is a grain of truth in them. The problem is that
it's just a grain of truth. It's a wonderful article. Read ["Fact and Folklore
In Software](<http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html>).
