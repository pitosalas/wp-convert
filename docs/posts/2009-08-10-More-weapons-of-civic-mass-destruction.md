A while ago I wrote about [weapons of civic mass
destruction](</2009/04/25/weapons-of-civic-mass-destruction-2522/>). I think
it is very disturbing to see and hear the way [Town Hall meetings being
disrupted by enraged people aggressively questioning speakers in public
forums](<http://news.google.ca/news?q=disruptions%20town%20hall%20meetings&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wn>).

It's not about agreeing with one side or another. But a community or a society
or a nation fundamentally rests on basic conventions of civility and human
interaction, and I am not sure exactly where it leaves us when those go out
the window. I don't know really what concretely can be done to fight back to
these disruptions without stifling discussion between people who disagree with
each other, without stifling free speech.

I mean what do you do if you are trying to explain and respond a position
(which may be unpopular with your listeners) and people start screaming and
hollering at you. How do you respond to this without actually killing
discourse?
