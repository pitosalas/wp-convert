>> The highly anticipated Mac OS X "Tiger" arrived in my hot little hands, and
I've spent most of the day installing it (2 hours) and getting everything to
work again (6 hours and counting.)

>>

>> One of the highly touted new features is "Dashboard" which is a "not quite
as good as" **knock-off** of [Konfabulator](<http://www.konfabulator.com/>).

>>

>> One of the widgets is a 'translation widget" to translate from one language
to another. I've no idea whether the translation is on board or being
outsourced to a web site.

>>

>> It works pretty well, but you can have **fun** with it, by translating the
same phrase back and forth.

>>

>>> "Why are you looking at me?"

>>>

>>> "¿por que usted me esta mirando?"

>>>

>>> "why you are watching to me?"

>>>

>>> "¿por que usted esta el mirar a mi?"

>>>

>>> "why you are to watch at me?"

>>>

>>> "¿por que usted esta el reloj en mi?"

>>>

>>> "why you are the clock in me?"

>>>

>>> "¿por que usted esta el reloj en mi?"

>>

>> At which point it stabilized asking me about the clock in me.

>>

>> Ok, so some of those hours were **spent playing around**!
