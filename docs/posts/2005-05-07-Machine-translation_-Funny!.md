The highly anticipated Mac OS X "Tiger" arrived in my hot little hands, and
I've spent most of the day installing it (2 hours) and getting everything to
work again (6 hours and counting.)  One of the highly touted new features is
"Dashboard" which is a "not quite as good as" **knock-off** of
[Konfabulator](<http://www.konfabulator.com/>).  One of the widgets is a
'translation widget" to translate from one language to another. I've no idea
whether the translation is on board or being outsourced to a web site. It
works pretty well, but you can have **fun** with it, by translating the same
phrase back and forth.

>>> "Why are you looking at me?" "多por que usted me esta mirando?" "why you
are watching to me?" "多por que usted esta el mirar a mi?" "why you are to
watch at me?" "多por que usted esta el reloj en mi?" "why you are the clock in
me?" "多por que usted esta el reloj en mi?"

>> At which point it stabilized asking me about the clock in me.  Ok, so some
of those hours were **spent playing around**! Technorati Tags:
