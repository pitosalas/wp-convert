**Link: [Avoiding the soft delete anti-pattern](https://www.cultured.systems/2024/04/24/Soft-delete/):** "The main problem with soft deletion is that youâ€™re systematically misleading the database. This is most obvious in the case of foreign key constraints."

I had never thought of this. It makes sense. Interesting.
