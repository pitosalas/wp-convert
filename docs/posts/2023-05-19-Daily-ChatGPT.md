I have been using ChatGPT on a daily basis. Not for joking or playing but for
work. It is like a super search engine combined with a fallible expert. When I
tell this story to various people they seem surprised and ask "Give me an
example." I have so many. So this will be a series of daily examples where
ChatGPT made a difference.

By the way, people love to say, ChatGPT is nothing more than fancy
autocomplete. While they may be technically correct (and I doubt they are) you
cannot ignore ChatGPT feats that look nothing like autocomplete.
