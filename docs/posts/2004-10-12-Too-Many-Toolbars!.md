**Link: [Too Many Toolbars!](None):** ""

Everyone wants to give me a toolbar! I've successfully fought back Yahoo's and
am a happy user of [Google's Toolbar](<http://toolbar.google.com/>).

>>

>> [Now A9 has a toolbar too.](<http://toolbar.a9.com/>)

>>

>> Have you checked out [A9](<http://www.a9.com>)? It's Amazon's Search
Service. What does Amazon want with a Search Service? Don't ask me! **Does the
world need another one**?

>>

>> I guess I am all for trying to improve on what exists. But in the case of
A9, they license Google results and then "add value." For me the value isn't
persuasive yet.

>>

>> But geez, do I have to decide now between the Google toolbar and the A9
Toolbar? Puleez!

>>

>> But **here 's a tidbit **for you: if you use A9 then [you get a little
discount ](<https://www.amazon.com/gp/xs/sharethepi.html>)on your Anazon book
order. It's only 1.5% (or so ðŸ™‚ but still **if you order a lot of books, it
could add up!**
