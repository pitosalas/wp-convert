So I received two new **Discover cards** , with supposed enhanced security
features. I didn't ask for them, they just sent them to me. I got a new
account number which is a pain because various merchants directly bill my
credit card and they will have to be updated, by me.

You know the little stickers on the credit cards, call xxx-xxx-xxxx to
activate your credit card? Do they actually do anything or add to security?
Would the card not work if I didn't call the number?

Well the nice lady who got on the line to activate my card promptly switched
scripts and (after thanking me for being a customer for sooo long) promptly
started selling me something.

How annoying. Tricked **me** into calling **them** to get their sales pitch.
