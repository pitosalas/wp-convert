I had the opportunity to be a guest lecturer at Brandeis University today,
which was fun. Brandeis of course is my Alma Mater, so I was quite at home
there. The course was about "Internet and Society" and the section was about
Collaboration. [Here are my
slides](</Brandeis%20CS%20on%20Collab_files/frame.htm>), for those few who
might be interested.
