As a naturalized citizen who's lived here for most of his life, Football used
to be foreign to me. I grew up knowing soccer and baseball but for the first
years Football was a mystery.

Now I have a pretty good grasp of football and enjoy watching games on TV. But
then I come across something like this, and I am stumped and can't decode it.
If only there was a good football tutorial (don't worry I already have
"Football for Dummies".)

This is from ["Oh, did this unit of the Patriots struggle against the Jets",
in the Boston
Globe.](<http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2011/01/18/oh_did_this_unit_of_the_patriots_struggle_against_jets/>)

Now I have some questions. Nickel to me means **five**. So how does that turn
into four linemen and two linebackers? And Dime to me means **ten**. How does
that translate into six defensive backs?

Somedayâ€¦
