>> Over the last week or so I've been working around the clock preparing for
[BlogBridge's ](<http://www.blogonevent.com/>)appearance at the BlogOn 2005
conference in New York City.

>>

>> Contemplating this at the end of the first day, I have to say it's been a
blast although quite different from what I've done in the past.

>>

>> This morning, before 7:00am I left my hotel on 23d Street for the half hour
walk to the [Copacabana](<http://www.nightclubvip.net/club/copacabana.asp>).

>>

>> In my backpack was a computer, power supply, 250 1 page "sales sheets"
(color fliers) and a bunch of business cards. I was headed for a 2 day
conference where BlogBridge is being highlighted as one of Chris Shipley's
BlogOn 2005 Innovators. An honor for us, and great visibility for BlogBridge.

>>

>> But the feeling was, " **I am my own PR agency**." Today was preceeded of
two weeks of scrambling, tightening up the web site, the positioning, the
FAQs. Pushing to get some last important refinements into the product.
Finalizing the sales sheet, getting it printed at VistaPrint, dealing with a
misprint and re-order. Preparing a series of Quicktime self running demos for
when I wasn't at the demo station. Oh, yes, and it sas just me at the demo
station the whole time

>>

>> **It was a great day**. I spoke with influential people. They listened and
took notes. We had a big day of downloads. And I got universally positive
feedback on what we are doing. Feels good!
