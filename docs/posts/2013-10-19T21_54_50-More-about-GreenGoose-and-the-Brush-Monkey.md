Amazing story of a great looking product, and awesome demo, on the spot
investment of $100,000 and still… **It didn 't work.** The story was told by
Scott Kirsner in the Boston Globe:

> "Today, GreenGoose is out of business, and Krejcarek is grappling with
> $80,000 in credit card debt -- his approach to funding the company after
> investors' money ran out earlier this year. When he says, "I'm trying to

> kidding." (from [The Boston
> Globe)](<http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/09/21/start-story-easy-

You have to admire that the founder of Green Goose (Brian Krejcarek) was
willing to share his experience with Scott and the rest of us. There are many
lessons there. To really appreciate the story you need to see how it started,
with the demo at the Launch Conference. It was an unbelievable and triumphant
presentation:

And yet. Here's a page of [Bonus
material](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/09/bonus_material_what_happens_af.html>)
where you can read more of how it ended:

> "Krejcarek says that the company spent much of the money it raised exploring
> different product concepts. By the time he launched Brush Monkey, there was
> about $200,000 left in the bank. The product wasn't simple enough for people
> to set up. And there was no big distribution partner putting it on store
> shelves and helping to promote it. "Distribution is probably one of the
> hardest problems for a startup to solve," he says." (from [Innovation
> Economy, Scott's
> Blog](<http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/09/bonus_material_what_happens_af.html>))
