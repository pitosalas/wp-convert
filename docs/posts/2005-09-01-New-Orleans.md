I've been away for several days, while following the catastrophe in the gulf
unfolding, via TV and radio. I (yes oddly) didn't have internet access but
thought to myself that there would be lots of very interesting blog posts
covering the events from a unique angle. And indeed, now that I came across
these two perspectives:

>>

>>   * "The police are looting. This has been confirmed by several independent
sources." from a [blogger working out of the Directnic.com data
center](<http://www.livejournal.com/users/interdictor/>).

>>   * "No one is saying that's what happened this time, but they should
figure out why the levee broke where and when it did, if the water topped the
levee and then eroded it out, or if it was helped along by someone with a
shovel or a bit of explosive." from [Dave Winer, who was a student in New
Orleans](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/08/31#When:8:39:53PM>).
