Here's something I **hadn 't seen before:** I IM'd a friend of mine at a Big
Company and the message got **rejected** because it included a **URL**. I have
to suppose that it's any URL that gets bounced, but who knows?

So the **workaround**? I sent the text for a **Google** query that returns the
same url.

Further details: Discussing it with him, the logic seems to be that someone
could send an employee a phishing link in an IM message.
