An [interesting view on patents from Judge
Posner](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/opinion/nocera-innovation-nation-
at-war.html>):

> "In Posner’s view, many patents are unnecessary. Patents, he believes, are
> important for drug companies that spend hundreds of millions of dollars
> bringing a new drug to market — a drug that can easily be copied by a
> competitor. Without the protection that a patent affords, pharmaceutical
> companies would have far less incentive to come up with new drugs." (from
> [New York Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/opinion/nocera-
> innovation-nation-at-war.html>))

In another article that discussed Posner's view on patents: "[Why there are
too many patents in
America](<http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/why-there-are-
too-many-patents-in-america/259725/>)" (from The Atlantic)
