This article gives a [fascinating perspective on the disconnect between what
they teach in law school and what knowledge is required to actually be an
effective lawyer.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/business/after-law-
school-associates-learn-to-be-lawyers.html>) Some great facts from the
article:

> "Last year, a survey by American Lawyer found that 47 percent of law firms
> had a client say, in effect, “We don’t want to see the names of first- or
> second-year associates on our bills.” Other clients are demanding that law
> firms charge flat fees."

…and …

> "“Law school has a kind of intellectual inferiority complex, and it’s built
> into the idea of law school itself,” says W. Bradley Wendel of the Cornell
> University Law School, a professor who has written about landing a law
> school teaching job. “People who teach at law school are part of a
> profession and part of a university. So we’re always worried that other
> parts of the academy are going to look down on us and say: ‘You’re just a
> trade school, like those schools that advertise on late-night TV. You don’t
> write dissertations. You don’t write articles that nobody reads.’ And the
> response of law school professors is to say: ‘That’s not true. We do all of
> that. We’re scholars, just like you.’ "

…and…

> "In fact, many of these [law review] articles are not of much apparent help
> to anyone. A 2005 law review article found that around 40 percent of law
> review articles in the LexisNexis database had never been cited in cases or
> in other law review articles.

All these quotes are from the [New York Times article: "After Law School,
Associates Learn to be
Lawyers"](<http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/business/after-law-school-
