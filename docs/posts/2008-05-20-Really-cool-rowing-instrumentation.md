boat](<http://www.championmetrics.com/index.html>) rowing instrumentation
product. Here is a bit about it from their site:

> "The RowMetrics system is innovative in-boat instrumentation bundled with
> software to provide a complete measurement system.The revolutionary force
> sensors installed between the foot stretchers and the rails capture the
> amount of force being exerted by each rower on a stroke by stroke basis. It
> measures the balance between the right and left feet for each rower. Also
> captured is the total boat's performance and the deceleration after catch.
