# [Science and Religion](None)




Now there's a big topic, eh? A magazine that I don't normally read has a
[good, in depth, thoughtful article about the debate between Religion and
Science](<http://www.tnr.com/booksarts/story.html?id=1e3851a3-bdf7-438a-ac2a-a5e381a70472>)
(see what I just did?). It comes in the guise of a book review (oddly the
author has, himself, recently come out with a competing book, which does
undermine his objectivity a little bit.) Still, it's an excellent overview.

(Funnily enough, the factoid that stayed with me the longest from this article
is that Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the exact same day.
Talk about trivia!)

And by the way, why does he pick on Turkey? At any rate the article is about
much more (it's long) and in my opinion well worth reading.

p.s. Here's another example of the unfortunate process which seems to
[inevitably leading to putting magazines out of business](</2008/12/01/are-
magazines-committing-suicide/>). I read the article, am spreading the word,
without looking at any ads as far as I can remember, and certainly not
purchasing the magazine. We all want to get everything cheaper and cheaper or
even free, and so we get what we want, although in getting it we may be
killing the very thing.
