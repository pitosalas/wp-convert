photo_10842-_130x0.jpg?resize=130%2C94&ssl=1)I'm excited to tell you that I
just accepted a position as Visiting Lecturer at **[Olin
College](<http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-
colleges/franklin-w-olin-college-of-engineering-39463>) **for Spring 2013!
Actually the full name is Olin College of Engineering.

Olin is a small engineering college, actually in the [top ten of engineering
colleges](<http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-
colleges/rankings/engineering-no-doctorate>) according to US News' Rankings.
[Olin is a very young
college:](<http://www.wickedlocal.com/needham/news/x1831588790/A-gamble-in-
higher-ed-Olin-College-celebrates-10-years?zc_p=0#axzz2DCB97NPR>) it just
celebrated its 10th year!

I'll be teaching Entrepreneurship in a course called " **The Tech Startup** "
(at least I think that will be the name of the course.)

As you might know, I was teaching at[ Brandeis
University](<http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-
colleges/brandeis-university-2133>) over the last three years. The [course I
taught at Brandeis was more computer science
oriented,](<http://www.brandeis.edu/jbs/pastprograms/r2012/webappssocialnet/index.html>)
aimed at getting the students the experience and helping them gain the skills
to build software products in a way that looks like the real world.

At Olin the focus will be on the broader topic of how engineers should think
about startups, how to come up with products that have a chance at selling,
making sure they match what customers want and are willing to pay for. I

am still nailing down the details of the curriculum but it's very exciting to
have this opportunity and I am totally psyched about it!
