# [Scott Adams is still funny: Suing God](None)




Scott Adams of course is the evil genius behind Dilbert, which as you know I
am a big fan of. Scott also has a really funny blog. As proof, this is from
[the latest
post](<http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/09/suing-
god.html>) from [The Dilbert
Blog](<http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/>):

> Lawyer: “Where were you on the night of the tornado?” God: “Um, everywhere.
> Same as always. Go to Hell. Seriously.”
