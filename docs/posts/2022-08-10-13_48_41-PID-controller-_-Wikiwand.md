(**Web site except:** A proportional–integral–derivative controller is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value 
  
    
      
        e {\displaystyle e }
  
 as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms , hence the name.)
