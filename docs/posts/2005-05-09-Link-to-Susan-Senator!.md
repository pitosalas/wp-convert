>> [Susan Senator](<http://susansenator.com/>) has published a book: "Making
Peace with Autism":

>>

>>> "It's her memoir about our family, and how we have dealt with the autism
that afflicts our oldest son"

>>

>> (Susan is [Ned Batchelder's](<http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/>) wife.)

>> A book that I read recently about what it might be like to be autistic is
["The Curious Incident of the Doc in the Night-
Time"](<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400032717/foxwritings/102-1977025-6628123>),
or the book with the upside down dog on the cover.

>>

>> I thought it was an excellent book whether or not you are interested in
autism. It's an engaging and quick read. And if you don't know anything about
it, you are sure to get some new perspective.
