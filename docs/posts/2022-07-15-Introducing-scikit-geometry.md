**Link: [Introducing scikit-geometry](https://wolfv.medium.com/introducing-scikit-geometry-ae1dccaad5fd):** "One of those libraries that I was going to write, then I thought, someone else must have already written it. Then I googled and found: "The Python ecosystem is lacking a library with useful geometric types — we aim to fix this by introducing scikit-geometry.""
