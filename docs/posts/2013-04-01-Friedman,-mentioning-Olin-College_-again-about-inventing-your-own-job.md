Tom Friedman, quoting Tony Wagner, describes what he thinks should be taught
today (that isn't really being taught:)

> "“Today,” he said via e-mail, “because knowledge is available on every
> Internet-connected device, what you know matters far less than what you can
> do with what you know. The capacity to innovate — the ability to solve
> problems creatively or bring new possibilities to life — and skills like
> critical thinking, communication and collaboration are far more important
> than academic knowledge. As one executive told me, ‘We can teach new hires
> the content, and we will have to because it continues to change, but we
> can’t teach them how to think — to ask the right questions — and to take
> initiative.’ ” ( **from**[NYT - Need A Job? Invent
> It!](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/opinion/sunday/friedman-need-a-job-
> invent-it.html?ref=opinion&_r=0>))

You know, what's amazing, this is exactly what the philosophy at Olin College
of Engineering is! I've been teaching there for the last several months, a
course in entrepreneurship, and as I've gotten to know the students and the
other faculty, I've begun to understand their unique approach there.

Another quote:

> "We teach and test things most students have no interest in and will never
> need, and facts that they can Google and will forget as soon as the test is
> over,” said Wagner. “Because of this, the longer kids are in school, the
> less motivated they become. Gallup’s recent survey showed student engagement
> going from 80 percent in fifth grade to 40 percent in high school. More than
> a century ago, we ‘reinvented’ the one-room schoolhouse and created factory
> schools for the industrial economy. Reimagining schools for the 21st-century
> must be our highest priority. We need to focus more on teaching the skill
> and will to learn and to make a difference and bring the three most powerful
> ingredients of intrinsic motivation into the classroom: play, passion and
> purpose.” ( **from**[NYT - Need A Job? Invent
> It!](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/opinion/sunday/friedman-need-a-job-
> invent-it.html?ref=opinion&_r=0>))

If this interests you, you should read the whole article. And don't miss the
end:

> "In the U.S., 500 K-12 schools affiliated with Hewlett Foundation’s Deeper
> Learning Initiative and a consortium of 100 school districts called
> EdLeader21 are developing new approaches to teaching 21st-century skills.
> There are also a growing number of ‘reinvented’ colleges like the **Olin
> College of Engineering,** the M.I.T. Media Lab and the ‘D-school’ at
> Stanford where students learn to innovate.” ( **from**[NYT - Need A Job?
