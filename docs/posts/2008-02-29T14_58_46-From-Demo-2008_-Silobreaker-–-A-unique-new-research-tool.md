Joining the ranks of the growing number of **news aggregation and research**
sites is [Silobreaker](<http://www.silobreaker.com>), which I first met at
Demo 2008. **Two things** catch my interest with Silobreaker - try it by
[clicking here for a search on the topic
'Google'](<http://www.silobreaker.com/Search.aspx?q=google&rd=true>)

  * The result displayed for a search is **mult-dimensional or multi-media or whatever** you want to call it. In addition to the usual top stories about Google (for example) you find the top Videos about Google, a histogram showing article volume about Google over the last week, a concept network around Google. a map showing where in the world people are writing about Google. And more. Check it out yourself to see what I mean.

  * Silobreaker has made an effort to understand the **semantics** of the search, so if you type in the beginning of a search word, say "Boston" it displays a list of companies, places, people and keyphrases that start with Boston, and lets you disambiguate. That means to me that they are **keeping track of the meaning** of what you are searching for, which bodes well.

[**Anyway, play with it. It 's cool.**](<//www.silobreaker.com/>)
