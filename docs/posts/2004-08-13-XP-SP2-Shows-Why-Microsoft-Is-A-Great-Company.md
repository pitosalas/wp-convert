I've said (and believe) that there's **no other company on earth** that has
the capability to develop, debug, beta test, deliver software on a massive
scale like Microsoft.

>>

>> The number of configurations (both legal and illegal) of hardware, system
sofyware, application software, languages, etc that XP has to be tested
against **totally boggles the mind.**

>>

>> I truly believe that not IBM, Apple, BEA, Oracle or any of them have the
capability to do this at the **scale Microsoft does it**.

>>

>> This at some level is a **key competitive advantage** and provides them the
**monopoly lock-in** that they enjoy. So when that capability ceases to be a
competitve advantage is when their monopoly will start eroding.

>>

>> So let your imagination **run free** : if all software becomes centralized
on servvers, if massive scale software like XP becomes obsolete, when all
hardware becomes so cheap that you just throw it out instead of upgrading it,
maybe then Microsoft might loose their lock-in.

>>

>> **Not before.**
