You know the old joke that today they say something is good for you, tomorrow
it's bad, and the day after it's good again? Recently there was a lot of press
that sitting 3 hours a day could take years off your lifespan. "[Sitting for
More Than Three Hours a Day Cuts Life Expectancy", so said the Wall Street
Journal:](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303343404577516853567934264.html>)

Yeah but I thought: nowadays, a major part of the economy involves sitting for
more than 3 hours. Start with office work. But add truckers, and pilots, and
other kinds of drivers, people working in many kinds of factories, I mean, are
we all doomed?

Oh **don 't panic **just yet. ["Don't Blame Sitting-Yet-for Shorter Lives", so

a short while later:

Phew. That's a release. I can **sit down again!**
