A fascinating although quite long article by Michael Lewis in Vanity Fair.
Michael Lewis is an amazing non-fiction writer, best known to me for Moneyball
(about baseball) and Liars Poker (about Wall Street.)

[Michael Lewis: Did Goldman Sachs Overstep in Criminally Charging Its Ex-
Programmer? | Vanity
Fair](<http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-
programmer>):

> A month after ace programmer Sergey Aleynikov left Goldman Sachs, he was
> arrested. Exactly what he'd done neither the F.B.I., which interrogated him,
> nor the jury, which convicted him a year later, seemed to understand. But
> Goldman had accused him of stealing computer code, and the 41-year-old
> father of three was sentenced to eight years in federal prison.
> Investigating Aleynikov's case, Michael Lewis holds a second trial.
