> project. He assembled a team who helped him create an outside studio at Bois
> de Boulogne, a park located near Paris that's 2.5 times the size of New
> York's Central Park. He stopped joggers, asking them for a favor - would
> they sprint for him and then pose right after for his camera? Many obliged.
> Out of breath, these joggers showed an overwhelming amount of fatigue on
> their faces." [Check this
