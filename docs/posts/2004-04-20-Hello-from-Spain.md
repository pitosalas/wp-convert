>> Geeking out from an Internet Cafe in Granada, Spain. We´re here for a short
vacation, and we have a little time to kill this afternoon so I thought I´d
quickly post an update for those of you who know (or care) that we are away.
Granada is a nice little town in Southern Spain, with a Moorish or Middle
Eastern influence. We spent hours yesterday wandering around the Alhambra,
which was great, although we are paying with our feet today… Tomorrow we leave
for a few days in Sevilla. See you there.
