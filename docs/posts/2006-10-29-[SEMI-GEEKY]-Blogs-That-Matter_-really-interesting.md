**Link: [[SEMI GEEKY] Blogs That Matter: really interesting](None):** ""

From [LifeHacker](<http://www.lifehacker.com/software/bloglines/find-feeds-
that-matter-209796.php>) (one of my new favorite sites) comes a pointer to a
site called [FeedsThatMatter](<http://morpheus.cs.umbc.edu/bloglines/>).

> based aggregator service and so I'd guess that their subscriptions are

> [musings](</weblogs/archives/001349.php>) on [bridging the gap between all

>
>   1. The feedosphere doesn't come close to covering the breath of topics of
> interest that one might have
>
>   2. BlogLines subscriptions are very caught up in the tech world because
> that's their user base.
>
>   3. FeedsThatMatter confuses popularity with value. Perhaps the feeds are
> out there but , by the BlogLines statistics they don't matter.
