> In light of my [recent](</weblogs/archives/001350.php>)
> [musings](</weblogs/archives/001349.php>) on [bridging the gap between all
> the great content out there in feed land and regular
> people](</weblogs/archives/001346.php>), this algorithmic analysis of topics
> and interest levels is an interesting data point. You can see that the
> coverage is extremely spotty. I suppose you can draw different conclusions
> from this:
>
>   1. The feedosphere doesn't come close to covering the breath of topics of
> interest that one might have
>
>   2. BlogLines subscriptions are very caught up in the tech world because
> that's their user base.
>
>   3. FeedsThatMatter confuses popularity with value. Perhaps the feeds are
> out there but , by the BlogLines statistics they don't matter.
