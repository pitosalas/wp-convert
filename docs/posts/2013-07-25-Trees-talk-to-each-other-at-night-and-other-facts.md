> " **Lies I 've Told My 3 Year Old Recently**

> Trees talk to each other at night.  
> All fish are named either Lorna or Jack.  
> Before your eyeballs fall out from watching too much TV, they get very
> loose.  
> Tiny bears live in drain pipes.  
> If you are very very quiet you can hear the clouds rub against the sky.  
> The moon and the sun had a fight a long time ago.  
> Everyone knows at least one secret language.  
> When nobody is looking, I can fly.  
> We are all held together by invisible threads.  
> Books get lonely too.  
> Sadness can be eaten.  
> I will always be there."
