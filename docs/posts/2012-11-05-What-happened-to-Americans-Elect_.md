**Link: [What happened to Americans Elect?](None):** ""



Over the last year I mentioned "Americans Elect" several times: [Americans
Elect: Another
Opinion](<http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCoQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.salas.com%2Fimported-20111103233638%2F2012%2F4%2F6%2Famericans-

and [Americans Elect - A viable third

Without rehashing or rereading my previous posts, basically, AE promised to
get their candidate on the ballot in all 50 states by beginning the legal work
really early, while driving an online process to select a candidate. This was
their promise (from their own site)

Their web site was very credible and well done. (I [looked at it
now](<http://www.americanselect.org>), and it's still nice, but they
essentially concede that they failed without coming out and saying it.) They
had Thomas Friedman talking about them, and I was kind of excited about it.
But I became a little nervous about it when I saw a distinct conservative lean
in the candidates that they were putting up, and very few names I had ever
heard about. I wondered whether this was actually a highly sophisticated
operation that wasn't really what they were trying to appear to be.

Well it's been a while since I had heard of Americans Elect but I fully
expected them to carry through on their mission and promised. But I just
looked at the 'sample ballot" for my town, and Americans Elect actually are
nowhere to be found.

**I wonder what happened to them!**
