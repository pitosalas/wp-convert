[ The Case for Models | Concerning Quality](<
https://concerningquality.com/models/>) –An interesting idea, model based
testing. The aurhor says: “Again, I’m writing about models because I have a
deep desire to keep software minimal. While I don’t think it’s wrong to simply
buckle up and deal with the complexity and raw magnitude of implementations as
many of us do, that’s just not the path that I find appealing intuitively.”
