>>

>> Hot news for Tivo and iPod Fans. Coming soon to a computer near you!

>>

>>> "TiVo Inc. today is expected to announce a service that allows its digital
video recorders to save programs to iPods and PlayStation Portables, further
untethering television from time and place." ( **from** [LA
Times](<http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/cotown/la-fi-
tivo21nov21,0,1589292.story>))

>> Also covering the same story: [Associated
Press](<http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051121/ap_on_hi_te/tivotogo_expands>),
[New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/21/business/media/21download.html?ex=1290229200&en=2b53054eb7d13755&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss>),

>> So what do I have to add? Not a whole lot, **except this question** :
currently, [Tivo doesn't provide "Tivo ToGo"
connectivity](<http://www.tivo.com/4.9.4.1.asp>) to Apple Macintosh OS X, only
to Windows XP. I hope that Apple is working with Tivo to address this!
