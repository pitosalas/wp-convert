Ok this is a bit irreverent.

There's been a spat relating to the note that Barack Obama wrote and left in
the stones of the Western Wall (the "wailing wall"). This tradition goes way
back.

The [spat is about the fact that someone pulled it out and photographed it and
it's been all over the
papers.](<http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2008/07/25/israeli_newspaper_publishes_obamas_private_prayer/>)

I agree that this was an awful invasion of privacy and inappropriate, which is
why I resist the strong temptation of putting a copy of the letter.

But how my weird mind works: the letter was a very nice generous and humble
statement. But I found myself looking to the end to see how Mr. Obama 'signed'
the letter. Well it was unsigned, which struck me for some reason as funny.  
  
I mean I guess the intended recipient of the letter would know who wrote it. I
guess that's the difference between a letter and a prayer.
