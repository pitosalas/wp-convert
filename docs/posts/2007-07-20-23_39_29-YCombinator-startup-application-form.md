I came across this very cool and simple set of [criteria or rules to apply for
funding from YCombinator](<http://ycombinator.com/w2008.html>). Not sure how
well it works for them but they are quite reasonable. Here's a sample:

> "(4) Yes decisions will include the amount we'll invest and the percent of
> the company we'd want for it. We usually invest $5000 + $5000n, where n is
> the number of participating founders (i.e. 2 founders get $15,000, 3 get
> $20,000), in return for between 1% and 10% of the company. The median is
> 6%."

Cool. Does it work?
