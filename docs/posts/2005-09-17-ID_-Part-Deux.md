If you are interested in the **Intelligent Design** debate, this is an
[fascinating and somewhat surprising](<http://people-
press.org/reports/print.php3?PageID=988>) article about a survey done by the
Pew Research Center for the People. As usual with this kind of thing it is
useful to **know the bias** of the folks doing the survey, which I have not
looked into at all.

open to the idea of teaching creationism along with evolution in the public
schools, and a substantial minority (38%) favors replacing evolution with
creationism in public school curricula." (**from** "[Religion: A Strength and
Weakness for Both Parties](<http://people-
