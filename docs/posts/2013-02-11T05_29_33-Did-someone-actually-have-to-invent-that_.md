A really charming article about [John Karlin who was one of the first UX
guys](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/john-e-karlin-who-led-the-
way-to-all-digit-dialing-dies-at-94.html>). He worked at Bell Labs back in the
day and helped determine lots of little details about how telephones are
designed. Simple silly things like that putting a dot (to "aim" at) visible
through each finger hole of a dial phone improved accuracy and speed of
dialing.

He determined, through testing, the best shape (square) and arrangement (a
rectangular grid) and ordering (1-2-3 in the top row) of the buttons in touch
tone telephones. Yes many other options were scientifically tested.

He also tested the impact of shortening the handset cables, and whether people
could handle phone numbers that didn't include letters to aid memory.

[Great article if you like to learn about inventors and
invention!](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/john-e-karlin-who-led-
