**Link: [Talking points memo: who’s obsessed now?](None):** ""

I'm a huge fan of [Talking Points Memo](<http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/>),
Josh Marshall's blog. In fact it's my exhibit #1 for people who ask me for a
good blog to read (assuming they are "liberal." If they are not I point them
to Instapundit.)

>>

>> Anyway just a **few words** about [Josh Marshall's complaint about how the
spinmeisters
positioned](<http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_10.php#003687>)
Kerry's comment about Cheney's daughter the other night. They called it "A
crass, **below-the-belt** political strategy to attach the president's
daughter."

>>

>> Well, my reaction was the same as Mr. Marshall's - how can they call what
Kerry said an attack? You can call it a lot of things but not an attack. But I
was **amused** by this comment in Josh Marshall's blog:

>>

>>> "And 'below-the-belt'? Like 'cheap and tawdry', why are all the criticisms
coded in **sexual language**?"

>>

>> **Hmm.** Below the belt actually is a boxing term not sexual language at
all. Now who is being **cheap and tawdry**! And by the way, in his last
paragraph:

>>

>>> "It's a telling example of how the **heavy-weights** on the cable nets,
the gilded and the **gelded** , …"

>>

>> **Heavy-weights** is another boxing term, I think. But gilded and
**gelded**? I don't know, the whole thing struck me as **funny**!
