**This puzzled me.** Once we released the [BlogBridge
](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)source code under the LGPL, it was out in the
open, and published to the world. **Had we forfeited the right to change the
license?** The answer depends on who owns and holds the Copyright to the code.

>>

>> As it is, all the code was either personally written by me (90%) or written
by others who have agreed to transfer ownership to me. In other words,**I hold
a clear copyright to all the code, and that is the key**. This makes it
**legitimate and legal to** reissue the same source code under a new license.

>>

>> What existed before (i.e. everything up to 0.5.3) under [LGPL
](<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html>)will not cease to exist or be
available under the LGPL, but, all continuing work, enhancements and so on
will be governed by the [GPL ](<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>)and
that's what counts.

>>

>> So the key requirement is that, no matter what the open source license is,
do you have clear ownership and if you do, **you can re-release it under a
different license.** Makes perfect sense once you hear it.
