[Qwiki seems to create multi-media presentations on any topic at
all.](<http://www.qwiki.com>) I picked an odd topic, like "[BlogBridge", and
it did a half decent job](<http://www.qwiki.com/q/#!/BlogBridge>). I don't
know how automatic or human-driven it is, but it's interesting.

Another interesting find is [Fotopedia](<http://www.fotopedia.com>), "The
First Collaborative Photo Encyclopedia". It's interesting but it suffers from
an unclear mission. I think it's trying to be wikipedia meets flickr, but I am
not sure. [As you can see from this link, there's some actual connection to
Flickr](<http://www.fotopedia.com/items/flickr-3255348609>). Are they using
Flickr to prime their pump?
