# [Sign up for Jason Calcanis email list!](None)




[Jason Calcanis has stopped
blogging](<http://www.calacanis.com/2008/08/18/updates/>) and instead is doing
an [email only mailing list
](<https://my.binhost.com/lists/listinfo/jason>)(yes, how 1999 of him.) I had
heard about it but recently got me a copy of his most recent missive.

Interesting, opinionated, practical and easy to read. I recommend it!

I've never met Jason but I've been in his presence as he forcefully (and
humorously) debated this or that luminary. Feisty guy, experienced and
articulate. Most recently he founded [Mahalo.com,](<http://www.mahalo.com/>)
which was well covered when it first launched but now I don't hear that much
about it.

list](<https://my.binhost.com/lists/listinfo/jason>).
