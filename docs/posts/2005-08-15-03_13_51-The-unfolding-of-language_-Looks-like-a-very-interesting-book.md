>> I came across this review in ["World Wide
Words"](<http://www.worldwidewords.org/index.htm>), an email newsletter
(remember those?) about â€¦ well, words. Here's an excerpt from the review:

>>

>>> "He takes readers through introductory topics such as syntax, case
endings, grammatical gender, and the curiosities of Semitic nouns, in which a
set of three consonants creates a template within which detailed meaning is
carried by the interspersed vowels (so shalom, salaam, Solomon, Islam, and
Muslim are variants on the root s-l-m).

>>>

>>> He quotes examples in English of what seem to be abrupt changes in sense--
resent three hundred years ago mean to appreciate or feel grateful for,
practically the opposite of its modern sense." (from World Wide Words, ["The
Unfolding of Language"](<http://www.worldwidewords.org/reviews/re-unf1.htm>))

>>

>> Sorry, but I love stuff like that.
