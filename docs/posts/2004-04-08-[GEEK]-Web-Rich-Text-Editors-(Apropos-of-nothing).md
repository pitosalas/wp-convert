>>

>> I've had occasion to look into what kinds of rich text editors are availble
out there, and I thought I'd use this as a place to record the results, for
myself, for you, and for posterity.

>>

>> Basically I am looking for a Rich Text Editor that can be embedded in a
browser based application. Here are the requirements:

>>

>> - Needs to run cross platform (IE, Mozilla, Safari)  
> - Doesn't need to be hugely featureful  
> - The less of a download the better  
> - Avoid stepping into a cross platform testing quagmire
>>

>> So far, here's what I've come up with:

>>

>> [This one ](<http://www.kevinroth.com/rte/demo.htm>)looks nice, is
lightweight and sufficiently functional.

>>

>> [This one is much heavier weight, and is very
functional](<http://kupu.oscom.org/>)

>>

>> I will post more results of my research as I continue. If you know of any
that I should take a look at, please drop me a line or post a comment.
