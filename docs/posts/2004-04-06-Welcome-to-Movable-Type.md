# [Welcome to Movable Type](None)

>> If I did things correctly, you should not have noticed too much different.
But today, with the help of [Dennis Doughty](<http://www.doughty.org/>), I've
switched to using [Movable Type ](<http://www.movabletype.org/>)as my blogging
software. It's no picknick, let me say that. My only reason to switch really
was to make it easy for me to post from different computers. Other than that,
I was happy with [Radio Userland](<http://radio.userland.com/>), and in fact I
will miss certain things I've gotten used to in Radio. We'll see how it goes.
Please let me know if anything breaks!
