I was talking with [Noah Mendelsohn](<http://www.arcanedomain.com/>) this
morning and we got into a discussion about [RDF](<http://www.w3.org/RDF/>) and
it's role in the world. Noah mentioned something called
[DBPedia](<http://dbpedia.org/About>) which I had not heard of.

[DBPedia](<http://dbpedia.org/About>) but it turns out to be a platform that
grabs and analyzes Wikipedia content and delivers all that it can as an RDF
Service. This sounds a lot like [Freebase](<http://www.freebase.com/>),
[another service which I am a fan of](</2007/11/23/freebasecom-is-the-
semantic-web/>) too, which has it's own representations and standards, but
among many other things, grabs and analyzes Wikipedia content and optionally
delivers it, yes, as an [RDF](<http://www.w3.org/RDF/>) service.

Check out my [write-up on Freebase if you'd like to know how I see
it](</2007/11/23/freebasecom-is-the-semantic-web/>).

I know that I am selling both services short. But the point is that they
sounded so similar that we started thinking were confusing the two. Apparently
I am not the only one to see the similarity and wonder about it. Here's an
[article by James Simmons wondering about the same
thing](<http://www.semanticfocus.com/blog/entry/title/cross-pollinating-
dbpedia-and-freebase/>):
