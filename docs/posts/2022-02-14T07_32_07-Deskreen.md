[ Deskreen](<https://deskreen.com/lang-en>)

Deskreen is a desktop app that turns any device with a web browser into a
secondary screen for your computer over WiFi. Deskreen can be used to mirror
entire computer display onto any device screen that has a web browser. Also
you can limit Deskreen to select only one application window view to share -
very useful for presentation purposes. The best feature of Deskreen is to use
any device as a secondary screen. To have a true extended desktop experience
Deskreen should be used with Virtual Display Adapter. Also with no need for
Virtual Display Adapter you can have a teleprompter with Deskreen using your
tablet or smartphone, for that Deskreen has Flip Screen Mode that mirrors
computer screen in web browser of your tablet (aka. flip screen horizontally).
