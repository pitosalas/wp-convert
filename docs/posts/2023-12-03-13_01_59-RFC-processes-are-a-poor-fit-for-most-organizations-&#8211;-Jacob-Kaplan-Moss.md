[ RFC processes are a poor fit for most organizations - Jacob Kaplan-Moss](<
https://jacobian.org/2023/dec/1/against-rfcs/>) â€“The RFC process has been a
huge success in defining the standards that run the Internet, but naively
adopting this process for your company is a mistake. RFC processes tend to
fail at most organizations because they lack a clear decision-making step.
