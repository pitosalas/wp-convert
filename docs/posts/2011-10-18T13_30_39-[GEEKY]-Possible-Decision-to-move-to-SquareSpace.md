I finally got my new blog on [WordPress.com](<http://www.wordpress.com>)
working. That should have been the simplest but their automatic spam detector
encountered a single post referencing some free iPhone upgrade service I once
mentioned. I had no idea that they were not legitimate at the time but anyway,
I deleted that mention and all was well again.

So now [WordPress.com](<wordpress.com>) looks like a good candidate. I know
[wordpress](<http://www.wordpress.org>) and I can run my blog, essentially
unaltered on their site, for free, and ditch my $25/month server that does
almost nothing other than serve up my blog.

Oh but there's a fly in the ointment. WordPress.com does not allow me to keep
my [TextLinkAds](<www.textlinkads.com>). And I make over $100 per month on
those so there goes the 'free' aspect of wordpress.com. It turns out that
[squarepspace.com](<http://www.squarespace.com>) has no so restriction, so
they are once more in the lead.

Just wanted to update you â€¦ and have an excuse to post so I can see how I like
this squarespace.com which at $12/month seems like a pretty good alternative
just about now. Right now I am waiting to see whether I will be able to import
my whole (6 years) of wordpress posts, while preserving the urls so my link
juice and ad revenue does't evaporate on me. I am optimistic.
