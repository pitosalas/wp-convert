I am (after 10 years) a beginner pianist who wants to improve. I practice, but
not diligently enough. On average I think I practice 5 days a week, for about
1/2 hour, so that's less than 3 hours a week. Clearly I could do better. But I
am proud of the effort I put in and I definitely have made a lot of progress.
But I am at best still an advanced beginner.

From an article,[ "If you're busy, you're doing something
wrong",](<http://calnewport.com/blog/2011/11/11/if-youre-busy-youre-doing-
something-wrong-the-surprisingly-relaxed-lives-of-elite-achievers/>)

> "We can start by disproving the assumption that the elite players dedicate

> The difference was in how they spent this time. The elite players were

> deliberate practice — the uncomfortable, methodical work of stretching your
