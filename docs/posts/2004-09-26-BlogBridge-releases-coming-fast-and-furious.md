>> BlogBridge is going **" Great Guns"** as I told my friend David in answer
to "What's going on with BlogBridge?" Well I don't really know what the heck
that means except that **I am pumped** to see the progress we've been making.
More and more every day. And now there's a way for you to see it too!

>>

>> We just made a [beta release (0.5.6)
](<http://blogbridge.com/install/beta/blogbridge.jnlp>)Betas have been coming
about once a month.

>>

>> **Beta releases** are tested (to a certain extent) on multiple platforms,
include a web site update, emails and so on. We also snapshot the source code
to SourceForge for the open source community.

>>

>> Well, we realized that **we have useful running code** more often than
that, so we've introduced the idea of an **Alpha release** , which is not
really tested but feels pretty stable and consistent. We will issue an update
email, do a very minor update to the web site, and again snapshot the source
on SourceForge.
