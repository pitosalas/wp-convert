Recently of course, because of the 'torture memos', the topic is all over the
papers and cable 'news' programs. It's brought back to mind a discussion that
was raging hot and heavy, starting back in 2001, about the idea of allowing
the issuance of ' **Torture Warrants** '.

[Alan Dershowitz](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz>), famous
Harvard Law Professor first espoused that in 2001 (as best I can determine) in
[this article in the LA
Times.](<http://groups.google.com/group/alt.impeach.bush/msg/814527884aa6c904>)
If you [search google
you](<http://www.google.com/search?q=torture+warrants+dershowitz&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a>) will see lots of hits on the topic, starting
then leading up to today.

This is from the New York Times:

> "Torture warrants, Dershowitz insists, are one way to shine law’s light on
> this darkness, especially if one believes there are times when torture
> should be permitted. Many will be horrified that Dershowitz even allows

The idea of torture warrants sounds crazy on first or second blush, but I do
see the point he's making. Technorati Tags:
