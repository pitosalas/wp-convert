>> "Dheera Venkatraman has released [Fooplot](<http://fooplot.com/>),  
>  a new website that plots any function, and supports Google Maps-style  
>  panning around.
>>

>> Fooplot is currently using SVG and VML to do the rendering and canvas  
>  support is coming for Safari.
>>

>> For good SVG browsers like Firefox and Opera, 3D plots work too.

>>

>> In the future, it will communicate with Google spreadsheets and  
>  interact with server-side scripts that do curve fitting and other  
>  tasks.
