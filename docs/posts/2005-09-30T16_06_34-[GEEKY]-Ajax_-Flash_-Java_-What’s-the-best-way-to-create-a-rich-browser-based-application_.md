>> This is a perenial debate with lots of sides. Here' s just some fodder for
those of you who are pondering the question:

>>

>> I guess right off the bat I would **exclude Java** for a browser based
application. Why? Unfortunately it requires a so-called JVM which may or may
not be present.

>>

>> **AJAX** on the other hand requires a 'modern' web browser, which I think
in this day and age (FireFox) is a **pretty safe bet**.

>>

>> And **Flash** requires the Flash runtime, which again, in this day and age,
is also a **pretty safe bet.

>>

>> **

>>

>> **Exhibit #1** : [Check out Zimbra](<http://www.zimbra.com/index.html>),
which, if you believe the web site is built with AJAX. Very impressive. All I
was able to see was the Flash demo ( **ironic** isn't it?) but it's quite
nice.
