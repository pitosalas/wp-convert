It turns out that Kaspersky Labs is developing a [brand new operating system
specifically designed to be used in embedded industrial systems and industrial
control systems](<http://eugene.kaspersky.com/2012/10/16/kl-developing-its-
own-operating-system-we-confirm-the-rumors-and-end-the-speculation/>).

In this article, [Eugene Kaspersky explains why his company decided to embark
on the creation of an operating system designed specifically and only for
embedded industrial control
systems.](<http://eugene.kaspersky.com/2012/10/16/kl-developing-its-own-
operating-system-we-confirm-the-rumors-and-end-the-speculation/>)

The obvious question:

> "First I’ll answer the most obvious question: how will it be possible for KL
> to create a secure OS if no one at Microsoft, Apple, or the open source
> community has been able to fully secure their respective operating systems?
> It’s all quite simple really.
>
> "First: our system is highly tailored, developed for solving a specific
> narrow task, and not intended for playing Half-Life on, editing your
> vacation videos, or blathering on social media. Second: we’re working on
> methods of writing software which by design won’t be able to carry out any
> behind-the-scenes, undeclared activity. This is the important bit: the
> impossibility of executing third-party code, or of breaking into the system
> or running unauthorized applications on our OS; and this is both provable
> and testable." ( **from** [Kaspersky Lab Developing Its Own Operating
> System? We Confirm the Rumors, and End the
> Speculation!](<http://eugene.kaspersky.com/2012/10/16/kl-developing-its-own-
