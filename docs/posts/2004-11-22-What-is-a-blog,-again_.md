**Link: [What is a blog, again?](None):** ""

My answer to the question: **" What is a Blog", **which I get asked often,
goes something like this:

>>

>> "A blog is a just a web site with articles or notes that get posted there,
generally by a single person. There's nothing especially new or complex about
the technology of blogs. What's new and compelling is the **blogging
phenomenon** : For whatever reason, individuals with unique and important
points of view are **choosing to publish** those in blogs."

>>

>> Actually **the point of this post** is to point you [this great and I would
almost say **moving** account by Kevin
Sites](<http://www.kevinsites.net/2004_11_21_archive.html#110107420331292115>),
keeper of [a photo blog](<http://www.kevinsites.net/>) that was very active
and interesting earlier this year and the year before.

>>

>> [Kevin Sites](<http://www.kevinsites.net/>) is a reporter who has been
covering the Iraq war from the inside. You might have heard about the video
tape of a marine shooting a prisoner which has made quite an uproar both here
and in the Middle East.

>>

>> It is, to me, amazing to be able to read, in Kevin Sites own words, what he
saw, what he thought about it at the time and now, and how it has unfolded for
him.
