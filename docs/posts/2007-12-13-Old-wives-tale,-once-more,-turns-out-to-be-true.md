**Link: [Old wives tale, once more, turns out to be true](None):** ""

Have you had this debate? Does cold weather cause people to catch colds more
easily or not? Well here's an interesting article that says there is
'scientific' proof that flu infections do in fact spread more during cold
winter months:

> "Researchers in New York believe they have solved one of the great mysteries
> of the flu: Why does the **infection spread primarily in the winter
> months**? The answer, they say, has to do with the virus itself. It is more
> stable and stays in the air longer when air is cold and dry, the exact
> conditions for much of the flu season." (from [New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/health/research/05flu.html?em&ex=1197090000&en=2b44d54a8b2870e1&ei=5087%0A>))

I always love it when long-standing 'facts' and 'beliefs' get **overturned**.
("Coffee is good for you, no, coffee is bad for you, no, wait, it's actually
good for you.")

However in fairness:

  * The article is talking about flu ("Influenza") not the common cold

  * The main part of the old wives tale is that you should **bundle up in cold weather** to avoid getting sick - which is not corroborated by the article

[Read the article, it's
interesting.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/health/research/05flu.html?em&ex=1197090000&en=2b44d54a8b2870e1&ei=5087%0A>)
