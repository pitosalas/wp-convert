>> [The other day I complained](</weblogs/archives/001162.php>) about comment
spam on my two blogs. Comment spam is when **fake** comments are added to a
blog post that include links to some random site. They are supposedly put
there by spammers to generate traffic to their sites, as well as try to
improve their site's ratings in Google. Whether it works for them I don't
know, all I know is that it's a **pain in the butt for** me.

>>

>> I am now using a Movable Type plugin called
[HMPassphrase](<http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/hmpassphrase.html>).
It's very **simple** and **effective**. Whenever anyone wants to post a
comment they have to read instructions on the web page and type in a certain
word into a certain field. The word is right there in the instructions. It's
super simple and yet the **spam robots can 't read the instructions** and so
can't enter the magic word and so can't even submit a comment.

>>

>> In one **magic stroke** my comment spam has gone from 10 or so per day, to
zero. **Nice**.

>>

>> p.s. I am also told that the WordPress [Akismet spam filter plug-in
](<http://akismet.com/>)is now available for Movable Type too and is **very
effective**. But for now I guess I don't need it.
