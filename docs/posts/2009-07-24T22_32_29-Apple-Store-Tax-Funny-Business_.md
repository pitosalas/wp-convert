A friend of mine pointed out that for some reason when he ordered is
(wonderful) iPhone 3GS, the Apple Store charged the **wrong amount for sales
tax.**

In Massachusetts, we are lucky enough to pay 5% sales tax.[ Actually this is
going up in a few days to 6.25%.

Anyway, I hadn't reviewed my bill from the Apple Store, but, wouldn't you
know, the error shows up in my bill!

If you look at the little screen shot of my bill, indeed, **this does not**
look like a 5% tax to me!

**What do you think? 9.8%! Who do I call?**
