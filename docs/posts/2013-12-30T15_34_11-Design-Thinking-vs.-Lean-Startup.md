### Point

[Solving Problems for Real World, Using Design -
NYTimes.com](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/technology/solving-problems-

A fascinating article about the "[Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford"
also known as the D.School](<http://dschool.stanford.edu>).

 Everyone knows that Design Thinking is great and the new hotness. I love
great design, and am in awe of it when I see it or have it pointed out to me.
Furthermore, I am blown away by Ideo, which is the famous industrial design
company founded by [David Kelly](<http://www.ideo.com/people/david-kelley>)
(what a mustache!), who is one of the founders of the D.School.

This is the same philosophy taught at [Olin College
](<http://www.olin.edu>)where I teach. At Olin we call it [UOCD or User
Oriented Collaborative Design.](<http://design.olin.edu/courses/uocd/>) In
fact at Olin there are numerous interesting courses that come at Design from
many different perspectives.

#### Counterpoint

Now the courses that I myself have taught have been based on so-called [Lean
Startup](<http://theleanstartup.com>) and I use the excellent book by Eric
Ries called [The Lean Startup](<http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-
Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898>). The Lean Startup process
receommends:

> "The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing
> startups and get a desired product to customers' hands faster. The Lean
> Startup method teaches you how to drive a startup-how to steer, when to
> turn, and when to persevere-and grow a business with maximum acceleration.
> It is a principled approach to new product development." (from The [Lean
> Startup)](<http://theleanstartup.com/principles>)

As I was reading the New York Times column about the D.School, I wondered if
the two approaches are different or the same, in conflict, or just two ways of
saying the same thing.And as I am writing this long post, I still am not sure.
The easy answer is they are two sides of the same coin. The provocative answer
is that two highly acclaimed approaches are 180% opposite to each other.
