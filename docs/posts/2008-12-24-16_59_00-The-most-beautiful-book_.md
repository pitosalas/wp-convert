Now here's a recommendation:

> "I recently got a hold of what I consider to be the nicest mathematical book
> in my collection. As a matter of fact, itâ€™s the nicest book I own, period -
> even though I posses bookshelves teaming with terrific titles on
> mathematics, science, programming, computer science, photography and so on."
> (from [Math-Blog](<http://math-blog.com/2008/12/22/the-nicest-math-book-i-
> own/>))

That goes right onto my wish list!
