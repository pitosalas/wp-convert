# [It’s even worse than you think](None)




Michael Lewis writes a [great article in Portfolio online about the, let's
say, inevitability, of what's happened to economy, or wall street, or the
markets](<http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-
news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom>) -- take your pick.
You can file this under "if you're so smart why aren't you rich", or, my
personal favorite, "it seemed like a good idea at the time."

Michael Lewis is the author of two of my favorite non-fiction books,
[Moneyball](<http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-
Game/dp/0393057658>) and [Liars Poker](<http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-
Rising-Through-
Wreckage/dp/0140143459/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1226603367&sr=1-1>).
Moneyball is about the use of modern statistical and quantitative methods in
managing baseball, and Liars Poker about his experiences on Wall Street at 24.
This is from the [Portfolio article:](<http://www.portfolio.com/news-
markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom>)

The article gets quite technical and I didn't follow more than 50% of the
financial chicanery but the overall message is comes through loud and clear:

> That’s when Eisman finally got it. Here he’d been making these side bets
> with Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank on the fate of the BBB tranche without

> There weren’t enough Americans with shitty credit taking out loans to

> Here, then, was the difference between fantasy finance and fantasy football:
> When a fantasy player drafts Peyton Manning, he doesn’t create a second
> Peyton Manning to inflate the league’s stats.

> But when Eisman bought a credit-default swap, he enabled Deutsche Bank to

> only difference was that there was no actual homebuyer or borrower.

It's a [good, but depressing article.](<http://www.portfolio.com/news-
