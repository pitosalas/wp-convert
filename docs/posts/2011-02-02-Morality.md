# [Morality](None)




This is actually a keynote to a conference, but it had some very interesting
ideas in it. The article is called ["The New Science of Morality" and it's by
Jonathan
Haidt.](<http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/morality10/morality.haidt.html>)

I don't know if it makes full sense out of context, but read this section. It
makes an important point and it might draw you into [reading the whole
thing](<http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/morality10/morality.haidt.html>).

> "[…snip]Morality is like The Matrix, from the movie "The Matrix." Morality

> it's like taking the red pill. You see, oh my God, I am in one particular
> matrix. But there are lots and lots of other matrices out there.

If you liked that one, there are two referenced articles, also worth looking
at:

  * [The WEIRDest people in the world](<http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1601785>)

  * _[Why do humans reason](<http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/MercierSperberWhydohumansreason.pdf>)_[? ](<http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/MercierSperberWhydohumansreason.pdf>)_[Arguments for an argumentative theory](<http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/MercierSperberWhydohumansreason.pdf>)_[.](<http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/MercierSperberWhydohumansreason.pdf>)
