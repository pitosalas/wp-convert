I [came across this a
little](<http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/milblogs.html>) while ago in
Wired about War Blogs. Pretty amazing stuff:

>>

>>> "Strong opinions throughout the military ranks in and out of wartime are
nothing new. But online technology in the combat zone has suddenly given those
opinions a mass audience and an instantaneous forum for the first time in the
history of warfare. On the 21st-century battlefield, the campfire glow comes
from a laptop computer, and it's visible around the world." (**from**
[Wired](<http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/milblogs.html>))

>> Read the [whole
thing](<http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/milblogs.html>) - it's
interesting. Technorati Tags:
