(**Web site except:** This is a pretty amazing article. Even though it's "non technical" and I read all of it, I think I only understood about 75%: "Stephen Wolfram explores the broader picture of what's going on inside ChatGPT and why it produces meaningful text. Discusses models, training neural nets, embeddings, tokens, transformers, language syntax.")
