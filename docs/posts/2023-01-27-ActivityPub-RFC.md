* **Web site excerpt:** The ActivityPub protocol is a decentralized social networking protocol         based upon the [ActivityStreams] 2.0 data format.         It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting         content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering         notifications and content.
