(**Web site except:** In this tutorial, we will go through the entire process, step by step, of how to detect lanes on a road in real time using the OpenCV computer vision library and Python. By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to build (from scratch) an application that can automatically detect lanes in a video stream from a front-facing camera mounted on a car. You’ll be able to generate this video below.)
