* **Web site excerpt:** Played with this a little. While google already searches all those other sources still i like the formatting of the output. Not sure if i will continuw to like it ad i use it more. But intriguing! Author dsys: “Search Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Amazon, & many more sites all at once. See all the results in 1 organized view.”
