Finally [someone writes about something
](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Collins-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all>)that
happens to me (and yes, to you) all the time.

  * What was that movie about that we saw LAST WEEK?

  * How come did it take till page 102 before you realized you had already red this book?

No friends, no need to feel shame anymore. It seems like it happens to
everyone (should I add, for you smart alecs out there - it happens to everyone
-- eventually.)
