Check out this post [Evidence of a Global
SuperOrganism](<http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/10/evidence_of_a_g.php>):

> "So far the proposition that a global superorganism is forming along the

Another great essay by Kevin Kelley. He's such a great writer. Here are some
other wonderful passages:

> "This megasupercomputer is the Cloud of all clouds, the largest possible
> inclusion of communicating chips. It is a vast machine of extraordinary
> dimensions. It is comprised of quadrillion chips, and consumes 5% of the
> planet’s electricity. It is not owned by any one corporation or nation
> (yet), nor is it really governed by humans at all. Several corporations run
> the larger sub clouds, and one of them, Google, dominates the user interface
> to the One Machine at the moment"

… and …

> "The span of the Machine is roughly the size of the surface of the earth.
> Some portion of it floats a few hundred miles above in orbit, but at the
> scale of the planet, satellites, cell towers and servers farms form the same
> thin layer. Activity in one part can be sensed across the entire organism;
> it forms a unified whole."

… and …

> "Organisms can be smart without being conscious. A rat is smart, but we
> presume, without much self-awareness. If the One Machine was as
> unconsciously smart as a rat, we would expect it to follow the strategies a
> clever animal would pursue. It would seek sources of energy, it would gather
> as many other resources it could find, maybe even hoard them. It would look
> for safe, secure shelter. It would steal anything it needed to grow. It
> would fend off attempts to kill it. It would resist parasites, but not
> bother to eliminate them if they caused no mortal harm. It would learn and
> get smarter over time."

I could go on. It's a great, long, essay. Read it.
