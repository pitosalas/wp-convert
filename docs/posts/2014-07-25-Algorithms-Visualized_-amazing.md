Check out this article that shows off how visualizations can help you
understand how algorithms work. It's an amazing piece of work: Creatively, he
figured out how to illustrate an algorithm so I can better understand how it
works; Technically, the code that implements these visualizations is itself
very clever and elegant; and Aesthetically, the overall effect on the page
itself is quite beautiful. I am jealous!
