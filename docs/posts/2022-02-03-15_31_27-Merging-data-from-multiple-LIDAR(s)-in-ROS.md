[ Merging data from multiple LIDAR(s) in
ROS](<https://medium.com/@amritgupta1999/merging-data-from-multiple-lidar-s-
in-ros-e890fb60cbbf>)

Light radars or LIDARs are used in robotics, drone engineering, IoT etc. for a
wide range of applications. A typical lidar uses ultraviolet, visible, or near
infrared light to image objects. It can target a wide range of materials,
including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols,
clouds and even single molecules. They are used extensively in building
autonomous systems such navigation, detection, task actuation etc.
