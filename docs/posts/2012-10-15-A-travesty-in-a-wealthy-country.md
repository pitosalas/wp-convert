From the New York Times, an [article by Nick Kristof, describing a real-life
story of a friend of his and health
care.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/kristof-a-possibly-
fatal-mistake.html>)

Whenever I hear, "We have the best health care in the world", I think of
stories like this. It is a travesty that in a wealthy country like the USA,
there are 48 million Americans uninsured. Some 27,000 Americans between the
ages of 25 and 65 die prematurely every year because they don't have health
insurance. From the
[article](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/kristof-a-
possibly-fatal-mistake.html>):

> "Let’s just stipulate up front that Scott blew it. Other people are
> sometimes too poor to buy health insurance or unschooled about the risks.
> Scott had no excuse. He could have afforded insurance, and while working in
> the pension industry he became expert on actuarial statistics; he knew
> precisely what risks he was taking. He’s the first to admit that he screwed
> up catastrophically and may die as a result.
>
> Yet remember also that while Scott was foolish, mostly he was unlucky. He is
> a bachelor, so he didn’t have a spouse whose insurance he could fall back on
> in his midlife crisis. In any case, we all take risks, and usually we get
> away with them. Scott is a usually prudent guy who took a chance, and then
> everything went wrong." (**from** [The New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/kristof-a-possibly-
> fatal-mistake.html>))

Read the [whole article. The same could happen to someone you know.
