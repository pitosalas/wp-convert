An amusing article in Newsweek about Peter Arnell, self-styled renaissance
man, inventor of the "[Peapod](<http://www.gizmag.com/chrysler-introduces-gem-
peapod-neighborhood-electric-vehicle/10060/>)", a "a mix of Darth Vader, a
bullet train, and a Citroën deux chevaux":

> "[snip…] With no air conditioning and a top speed of 25 miles per hour, the
> $12,500 [Peapod is **basically a fancy golf
> cart**](<http://www.gizmag.com/chrysler-introduces-gem-peapod-neighborhood-
> electric-vehicle/10060/>). Arnell hopes people will buy them for doing
> errands around town. He wants to call customers "peaple" and has designed a
> line of accessories: pens, flashlights, T shirts, baseball caps, shopping
> carts, picnic baskets, yoga bags, gardening sets. He's even designed
> fragrance inserts that create an aromatherapy experience while you drive. "I
> would argue this business could be hundreds and hundreds of millions of
> dollars," he says. His counterpart at the meeting, a veteran Chrysler
> engineer, just nods and says, **" Uh huh."** ( **from** [Newsweek Mad

And the promised [exploding head scene from the same
article](<http://www.newsweek.com/id/191396/output/print>):

> "[… snip] if I stay much longer I fear that my **head might explode**.
> Either that or I'll burst out laughing. After I leave it occurs to me that
> the way to understand Peter Arnell is to think of everything he does as a
> kind of high-stakes performance art. Not just the commercials and
> advertisements, but everything—the meetings, the memos, the celebrity phone
> calls, the crazy brainstorming genius shtick. When it works, it works. Who
> knows why? You can study it, but you can't explain it. So Peter Arnell
> seduced PepsiCo into forking over millions of dollars, and gave them a memo
> about perimeter oscillations and the gravitational pull of a soda-pop can.
> Is that nuts? Probably." (from [Newsweek - Mad
> Man")](<http://www.newsweek.com/id/191396/output/print>)

I don't know… I thought it was an interesting/funny article.
