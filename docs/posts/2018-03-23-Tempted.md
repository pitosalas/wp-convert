I came across my old blog that I've not posted to in 3 years and, well, found
some really good stuff. I recently dropped all social media because it had
become a total time sync. Bit yeah, some really good stuff. Also WordPress is
a very nice platform. It's evolved right under me and now it's downright
pleasant to use. Maybe… Should I start blogging again?
