No, just kidding, I am **not.** Some of my best friends are headhunters and I
wouldn't want to compete with them.** But** I do **often** find out about
people in my network who are **looking** for new positions and I try to
**connect** them to those I know who are looking for new people. Recently
another person emailed me saying they were looking for someone, and I realized
that I might have lost track of what openings I know about. So - to those of
you who know me personally - if you are hiring, feel free to send me an email
so I can keep an eye out and connect you to candidates. _No, I don 't charge a
fee 🙂_ Technorati Tags: [jobs](<http://www.technorati.com/tag/jobs>)
