Long time readers of this blog (yes, I can say that now, it's been 2 years or
so ðŸ™‚ know that I am a
[Dave](<http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet>)
[Winer](</weblogs/archives/000295.html>)
[fan](</weblogs/archives/000575.html>) [and](</weblogs/archives/000343.html>)
a daily reader of [Scripting News](<http://www.scripting.com/>). In
yesterday's posts, [Dave talks about life and
death](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/01#morningCoffeeNotes>), honest,
open, sincere, like no one else can:

>>

>> "What's it like to die? Some people believe they know, but that's just a
belief. You won't know for sure until it happens to you. And that, my friends,
is both the curse and the blessing of humanity. It's the curse because it
haunts each of us from the age of seven or eight when it first hits us that
_we 're going to die too."_ (from [Morning Coffee
Notes](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/01#morningCoffeeNotes>),
Scripting News.)

>>

>> I remember, but for me it happened around age 11 or 12, but it was the same
experience.

>>

>> **Anyway** , it's Dave's birthday today, so this post is in his honor. As
it happens Dave and I are almost the same age. For me the big five-oh is
coming in about 6 months.

>>

>> So Dave, **Mazel Tov** on your birthday, and I hope to still be reading you
when we both are **eighty**!
