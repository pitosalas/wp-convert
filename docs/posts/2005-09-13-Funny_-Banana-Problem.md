>> This is from a dictionary:

>>

>>> **Banana problem** : _noun_

>>

>>> A situation of uncertainty about when a task is complete and therefore
when to stop working on it

>>

>>> The term banana problem is often used in computing when talking about
badly written or incorrect conditions for the termination of a computer
program. It has also been applied in website development, referring to a
situation in which a designer adds so many different features that the whole
thing looks messy, for example: 'If you insist on adding that video clip, I'm
afraid we're going to have a real banana problem on our hands.'

>>

>>> **Background**

>>

>>> The term originates from the story of a little girl who said 'I know how
to spell 'banana', but I don't know when to stop!'

>>

>>> In the computing world reference is often made to a one-banana problem, a
phrase which looks similar but in fact has a completely different meaning.
This term derives from the idea that those with less-skilled jobs in the IT
industry, such as computer operators, can be compared to monkeys, and
incentives given to monkeys (bananas) can be used to describe the level of
difficulty of a task. A one-banana problem is therefore the simplest, for
example: 'It's only a one-banana job'. In contrast, two- and three-banana
problems would constitute more complex activities."
