[ A Nibble of Geohashes in Go - by Kurt - Get Code](<
https://getcode.substack.com/p/a-nibble-of-geohashes-in-
go?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email>) –This is a really cool algorithm
that i never heard of. Also geohashes are not too hard to compute and have
very useful and unteresting properties. the concept of a z-order curve is
explained. That too is a useful model and concept. The author says: “Latitude
and longitude as a locality-preserving string.”
