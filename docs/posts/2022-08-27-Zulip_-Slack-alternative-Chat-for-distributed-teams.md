**Link: [Zulip: Slack alternative Chat for distributed teams](https://zulip.com/):** "Now that slack changed its pricing model it may be time to switch. “Zulip combines the immediacy of real-time chat with an email threading model. With Zulip, you can catch up on important conversations while ignoring irrelevant ones”"
