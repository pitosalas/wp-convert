**Link: [How a Kalman filter works, in pictures](https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures):** "Kalman filters are a mathematical process for smoothing out a noisy signal (its more complicated than that ) its a central algorithm in robotics and real time sensing systems in general."
