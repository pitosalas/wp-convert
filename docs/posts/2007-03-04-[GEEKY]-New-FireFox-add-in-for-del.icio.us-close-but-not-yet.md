I was glad to see that the [FireFox add-in for
del.icio.us](<https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3615/>) was revised to
combine the [features](<https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3615/history/>) of
the 'old one' with the features of the 'new one'. That's good. Unfortunately
it looks to me like the new and improved plug-in is still a bit buggy, sending
FireFox into a tailspin - window activation weirdnesses, apparent loops
hogging the CPU. I look forward to the next rev, because the concept is right
on.
