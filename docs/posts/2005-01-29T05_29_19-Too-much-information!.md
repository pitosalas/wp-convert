It's **one thing** to be interested in blogs so you can read and learn and
become aware of new ideas. But when it comes to joining into the discussions,
watch out! No it's more than the [well known
problem](<http://www.google.com/search?q=blog+discussion+threads&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8>)
of following discussion threads across blogs.

>>

>> It's just the ridiculous amount of stuff that gets written on any hot topic
(like Folksonomies, for example.) If you [want to
contribute](</weblogs/archives/000568.html>) a half-intelligent idea to the
debate, the number of links to follow and essays to read is very intimidating,
and certainly the odds of uttering an **original thought** approach zero. So
I'll **stop** here.
