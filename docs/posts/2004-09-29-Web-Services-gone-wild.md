>> Here's a **cool** idea: using the web services of **Google** and
**Technorati** together to find other, related blogs. Here's the idea:

>>

>> One of the things I am trying to do with [BlogBridge
](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)is to help users **discover** new blogs that
they would be interested in. **Let 's say **I am interested in finding other
blogs which are related to or similar to one of my favorites, [Scripting
News](<http://www.scripting.com>).

>>

>>   1. First we **ask Google** for other sites **' related to' **Scripting
news [(click here to see
result.)](<http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&q=related%3Ascripting%2Ecom>)

>>

>>   2. Starting at the second entry, we **ask Technorati** whether the
returned link is part of a blog. If so, **chances are** these are related
blogs.

>>

>> Now I chose Scripting News as my example **before I actually tried the
excercise** and I must admit it generated a weird set of so-called related
blogs:

>>

>>   * [The Power of Many](<http://x-pollen.com/many/>)

>>

>>   * [The Radio X-Factor](<http://www.radioxfactor.com/>)

>>

>>   * [Kotke.org](<http://kottke.org/>)

>>

>>   * [Surfin' Safari](<http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/>)

>>

>>

>> I actually had only heard of one of those. And I have to say I don't know
exactly why Google thinks that they are related to Scripting News, but still
it's an **interesting approach** that I will work on **refining** and then
incorporate into [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>).
