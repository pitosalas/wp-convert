**Link: [Tutorial on buying a telescope](None):** ""

Out of left (star) field. Here's a succinct tutorial on buying a telescope
that my friend [Ben Gomes Casseres
](<http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2741471&authType=name&authToken=8vju&locale=en_US&pvs=pp&trk=ppro_viewmore>)emailed
me which I thought might be of general interest. You can see [Ben's own
astronomy work here](<http://www.alliancestrategy.com/Astro>).

If you are thinking of buying a telescope (or giving one as a gift), Ben says:

> The place to go to browse is www.oriontelescopes.com. They have advice on
> entry-level telescopes and such. Have Dick review what is available there
> and then let me know….I can help select among options. I am not sure what
> you can get for 500-1000, as there is a tendency for them to sell things for
> kids that are very cheap that are not worth it (poor optics, or flimsy
> mount, or just over-promising.)
>
> As a general rule: Don't skimp on the mount (heavy is good) or on the size
> of the "objective" (essentially the "width of the tube"…no less than 3" if a
> "refractor" type and no less than 6″ if a "reflector" type). At the same
> time, make it something easy to set up and take out of the box, or else it
> won't be used. Don't be fooled by "power" as most observing is done at 50x
> to 150x and anything higher is usually wasted. Leave some funds for books
> and atlas to help find things and see what is interesting to observe on a
> given night; and perhaps a subscription to "Sky and Telescope" (the standard
> in amateur astronomy) or "Astronomy" (more basic). The sites for these mags
> also have reviews that may be helpful.
>
> You may find that a 3″ refractor (has a lens in front) on a nice mount might
> work; some are shorter than others (more $$) and offer wider fields of view.
> Or a "catadioptric" (lens in front + mirror in back and the optical path is
> folded on itself and so compressed in size) in the range of 6-8″. The most
> popular for many people is a 8″ Meade or Celestron catadioptric, which comes
> with mount and everything, but it is over 1k I would think. But check those
> out, as they are pretty good as one-size-fits-all instruments. Many other
> instruments are best for planets and moon but not for star fields and
> nebulas, or best for the latter but not the former.
>
> A great pair of binoculars (7×50), such as Fujinon or other high quality, is
> also very nice and may be a good way to start. There are books on "roaming
> the sky with binoculars" (see Sky and Tel website) and in dark skies you can
> see a lot of wide-angle stuff. But that does not give views of moon and
> planets.
>
> Hope this helps as guidance.
