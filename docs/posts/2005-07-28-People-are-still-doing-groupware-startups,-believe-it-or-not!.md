Being a veteran of the groupware movement (worked at Lotus for years, and co-
founded eRoom Technology) this item caught my eye:

>>

>>> "[Liquid Systems](<http://www.liquidsys.com/>), a venture-funded software
company that is focused on enterprise messaging and collaboration, according
to sources familiar with the company's plans." (**from**
[InfoWorld](<http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/13/HNbeadietzen_1.html?source=NLC-
AD2005-07-14>))

>>

>> I guess only the InfoWorld headline refers to "groupware" but it's a very
80's term, that even in the 90's we at eRoom avoided like the plague.
