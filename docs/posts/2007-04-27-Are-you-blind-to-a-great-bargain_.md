# [Are you blind to a great bargain?](None)




Here's a column that I can really relate to, and a topic that I've written
about more than once before.

> "Computers would be nothing without programs to run on  
> them, so why do we spend so much time drooling over our hardware --  
> physical bits and pieces -- and so little over the software that makes  
> the bits and pieces do what we want them to? And why are we so stingy  
> about paying for software?" (from [Blind to Bargains, Loose
> Wire](<http://online.wsj.com/article_print/SB117700152496775717.html>))

Read the [whole
article](<http://online.wsj.com/article_print/SB117700152496775717.html>),
it's really interesting!
