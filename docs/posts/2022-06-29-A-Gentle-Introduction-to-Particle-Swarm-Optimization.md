**Link: [A Gentle Introduction to Particle Swarm Optimization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-particle-swarm-optimization/):** "Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the bio-inspired algorithms and it is a simple one to search for an optimal solution in the solution space. It is different from other optimization algorithms in such a way that only the objective function is needed and it is not dependent on the gradient or any differential […]"
