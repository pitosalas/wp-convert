A company that was launched at the Demo conference (which i am going to this
year) is deploying in North Dakota:

>>

>>> "A **trial balloon** will be launched in the next few weeks to test the
idea, said Schafer, who left office in 2000 after eight years as governor."
(**from** [Associated
Press](<http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060130/ap_on_hi_te/cellular_balloons>))

>>

>> It just struck me as **funny**. (People ask: how much time does it take you
to do a post every day in your blog? This one took less than 100 seconds.
Would have been less if not for this parenthesized meta-joke.) Technorati
