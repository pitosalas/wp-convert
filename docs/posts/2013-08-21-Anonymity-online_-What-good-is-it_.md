Seth Godin is said to have said that anonymous commenting is not a good thing:

> "…Mathew, the forces for anonymous are running out of time. For almost two
> decades, the internet has been anonymous friendly, and what has come of
> it?…" ( **from** [GigaOm](<http://gigaom.com/2013/08/21/dear-arianna-
> anonymity-has-value-and-doing-away-with-it-wont-solve-your-commenting-
> problem/#comment-1358993>), via

Here's what Rosie O'Donnel said about Twitter, which gets to a similar point:

> "…Correct, and that's what it is. It's like standing on a stage in a
> darkened comedy club and people throwing shit at you and you still trying to
> do your act…" ( **from** [transcript of Here's the Thing
> interview)](<http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2013/jun/24/transcript/>)
