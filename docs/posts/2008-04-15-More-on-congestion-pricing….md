**Link: [More on congestion pricing…](None):** ""

From a few previous posts you know that I have a [curiosity about
congestion](</2008/03/26/how-gps-devices-are-being-used-to-detect-and-avoid-
traffic/avoid-traffic/>) pricing as a [way to allay traffic
jams](<http://http//www.salas.com/2008/03/22/what-does-urban-congestion-have-
to-do-with-mesh-networks/>), while raising [money to improve infrastructure
and alternative transportation.](</2008/03/18/casinos-in-mass-please-no/>)

In a recent post in the [Freakonomics
Blog](<http://http//freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/>), which I recommend,
there's an interesting Q&A on that very topic that you may want to take a look
at.

> "Most people now recognize that congestion is a serious problem and that
> something can be done about it. There is also a growing movement nationally
> to charge drivers more directly for the use of the roads and technology.
> This will make charging easier and more sophisticated in the future by
> allowing for time-of-day, day-of-week, and level of congestion pricing."
