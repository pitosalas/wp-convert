So a friend of mine told me of his iPhone app, called
[Etude](<http://etudeapp.com/>). He sung the praises, it sounds really cool to
me. So I whipped out my iPhone and went to download the app. Wouldn't you know
it costs $4.99. I turned to him and I said, hey, "it's not free!".

Yeah silly reaction, given how I've ranted myself about free and not-free. And
here's the funnier part still. He said, Oh, yes, it's $3.00. I said, "No it's
more like $5.00". He said, "Oh yes, we just raised the price." I gave him a
blank look.

Here's the kicker. He said, "What if I give you $5.00 right now?".

I still didn't want to buy it… How does that make any sense?
