**Link: [[teaching] A student’s perspective on course selection](None):** ""



I stumbled across this article while waiting for a meeting to start. It is a
bit "inside baseball", in this case "inside brandeis" but it was revealing to
me at least. Students can "shop" for courses for the first two weeks of the
term, attending classes and adding and dropping at will during that time as
they settle for their choices. I guess when I went to college they had that
too, but I wasn't aware of how it worked, so I never did it.

It makes for odd dynamics in the class room as for the first two weeks you
don't really know who to expect to see, who will show up next time, and
whether they are keeping up or not. This writer does not seem to be enjoying
his college experience as much as I did 🙂
