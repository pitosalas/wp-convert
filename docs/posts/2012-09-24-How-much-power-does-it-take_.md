**Link: [How much power does it take?](None):** ""



I remember wondering about this when I was in college -- this is before I
really knew anything about computers.

I noticed that our computer center charged by the **minute of processor time
and** it was a lot! I remember people freaking out because their random prime
number generator ran overnight and the department got billed an unexpected
$1,000.00. And they were in trouble!

So it must **cost a lot** to get these computers to do all these calculations,
I thought. So, I asked the local expert, how much does it cost, then, when the
computer isn't doing any calculations? He **laughed**. He said, it **costs the
same,** whether it's calculating or not. How weird.

Here's an interesting [article in the New York Times about the data canters of
companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and many many others, use and waste
a ton of electricity.](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-
centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?hp>) Here's
the hook:

> "Jeff Rothschild’s machines at Facebook had a problem he knew he had to
> solve immediately. They were **about to melt.** The company had been packing
> a 40-by-60-foot rental space here with racks of computer servers that were
> needed to store and process information from members’ accounts. The
> electricity pouring into the computers was overheating Ethernet sockets and
> other crucial components." ( **from**[New York
> Times)](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-
> vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?hp>)

But beware, here's something from an **immediate** rebuttal from Forbes, [
"Why The New York Times Story "Power, Pollution and the Internet" is a Sloppy
Failure"](<http://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2012/09/23/why-the-new-york-
times-story-power-pollution-and-the-internet-is-a-sloppy-failure/>)

> "So here’s the first problem that requires a clarification if not a
> correction. The utilization rates of servers in data centers is cited as
> between 7 and 12 percent. Nowhere is it pointed out that this statistic is
> derived from IT data centers, not from the state of the art data centers run
> by the Internet companies. Huan Liu based on an external model, estimates
> Amazon’s EC2 utilization at 7 to 25 percent. But Amazon, Facebook, and
> Google, don’t report their utilization rates. It is not accurate to make
> this implied association." ( **from**

You may read both articles and draw your own conclusion.
