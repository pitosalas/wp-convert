Another web app stack written in pure python. Claim to fame seems to be that it compiles pure python into a react front and and a FastAPI back end. Programmer does not need to know JavaScript, html, css etc. Which is nice. But for me personally it’s not the kind of structure I would want. But still worth a look I think!
