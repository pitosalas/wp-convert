You might have heard of [Nicholas
Negroponte's](<http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/>) ([Wikipedia
bio](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Negroponte>) - maybe better than
the one he wrote himself!) project to create a so-called [hundred dollar
laptop](<http://www.laptopical.com/cheap-hundred-dollar-laptops.html>). He
spoke about it at the recent Pop!Tech conference, and the first prototype was
unveiled last night. [Andy Carvin got a chance to
play](<http://www.andycarvin.com/archives/2005/11/the_100_laptop.html>) with
it and prepared this [very interesting video
documentary](<http://www.andycarvin.com/video/100laptop.mov>) about it. [Check
it out](<http://www.andycarvin.com/video/100laptop.mov>).
