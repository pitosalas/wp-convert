**Link: [Runno](https://runno.dev/):** "It has some similarities with things like JSFiddle or CodePen, but can run Ruby (as well as Python, C and C++). It can even act interactively and accept user input (such as with gets). You can then take these sandboxes and use them on your own pages/blog posts, etc."
