A [fascinating article,](<http://reason.com/archives/2012/01/26/how-much-is-
an-astronauts-life-worth>) which is hard to disagree with, although the
conclusion is a little counter-intuitive:

> "Imagine that the captain of a $5 billion aircraft carrier let his ship sink
> rather than allow seven volunteers to attempt a repair, on the grounds that
> the odds favoring their survival were only 50 to 1. Such an officer would be
> court-martialed and regarded with universal contempt both by his brother
> officers and by society at large." (**from** [How Much is an Astronaut's
> Life Worth?)](<http://reason.com/archives/2012/01/26/how-much-is-an-
> astronauts-life-worth>)

If you agree with this logic, it would be hard to argue with the case made in
the article, that the top priority of a space mission should be **Mission
Success** not **Human Safety**.

The article also very nicely puts a value on 'excess' expenditures for safety
in space exploration by looking at how many lives could have been saved if
those funds were spent on, for example, healthcare or immunizations.
