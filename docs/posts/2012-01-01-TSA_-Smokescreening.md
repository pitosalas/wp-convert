An interesting and fun to read [article in Vanity Fair about the security
check procedures](<http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/12/tsa-
insanity-201112>) established by the TSA:

> "Taking off your shoes is next to useless. "It's like saying, Last time the
> terrorists wore red shirts, so now weâre going to ban red shirts,"
> Schneier says. "If the T.S.A. focuses on shoes, terrorists will put their
> explosives elsewhere. Focusing on specific threats like shoe bombs or
> snow-globe bombs simply induces the bad guys to do something else. You end
> up spending a lot on the screening and you haven't reduced the total
> threat." (**from:**[Vanity

[Schneier](<http://www.schneier.com/>) of course is Bruce
[Schneier](<http://www.schneier.com/>) who is always interesting to read. He
writes about security and computers. I have quoted him many times before on
this blog.
