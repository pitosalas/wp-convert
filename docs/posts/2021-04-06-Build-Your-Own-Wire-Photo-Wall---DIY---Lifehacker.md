**Link: [Build Your Own Wire Photo Wall - DIY - Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/395358/build-your-own-wire-photo-wall):** "One of the rooms in my new place has a bare white wall that was just crying out for some creative sprucing up—so armed with this previous Lifehacker post on a DIY photo wall project and a few ideas on how to modify it for my own tastes, I went ahead and created a cheap, easily-reconfigured photo wall. For under 20 bucks, using some wire, black card stock, and mini binder clips, it's easy to create your own wire photo hanger. Let's take a photo tour of how to get the job done."
