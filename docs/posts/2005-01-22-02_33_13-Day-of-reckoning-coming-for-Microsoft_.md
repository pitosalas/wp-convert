You've heard this one before: there are more and more truly outstanding pieces
of software coming out as Open Source. Everyone has heard about FireFox,
right, the wonderful Web Browser from the Mozilla guys.

>>

>> I just came across [news that Internet Explorer usage fell
again](<http://www.activewin.com/awin/comments.asp?HeadlineIndex=27974>) for
the 7th straight month, and it seems that FireFox is taking up the slack. Take
a look at Thunderbird 1.0, another gem. Thunderbird is an email client and
[it's a very nice piece of
work](<http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/000893.html>). [You can
see both of these apps here.](<http://www.mozilla.org/>)

>>

>> I also recently read notice that there's a project starting to combine
several Open Source projects into an email, calendaring, and address book
behemoth. Might this challenge Microsoft Outlook? Sounds like an outlandish
thought doesn't it?

>>

>> You might know that I am a big Microsoft fan. I've said that only they have
the wherewithal to build, test and deliver massively complex software to huge
user bases. Don't be fooled: simplicity is good, but good software is usually
very complicated below the skin.

>>

>> My read is that with successful efforts like FireFox and Thunderbird things
may be getting interesting for Microsoft. It will take years, but I think we
are seeing some stormclouds on the horizon.
