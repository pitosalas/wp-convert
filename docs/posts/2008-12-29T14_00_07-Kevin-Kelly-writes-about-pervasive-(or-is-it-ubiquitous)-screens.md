I always love [Kevin Kelly's
writing](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-
future-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all>) and thinking and this article in a [recent
New York Times Magazine](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-
future-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all>) doesn't disappoint.

I have a hard time summarizing the article: Video is becoming more ubiquitous
than static print as the main mode of visual communication - not just TV etc,
but on any and all surfaces in public and private. This will lead to ways in
which regular civilians can create, modify, scan and consume video with
infinitely greater ease.

It's a good argument. Here's a semi random thoughtful bit:

> "Some popular Web sites with huge selections of movies (like porn sites)
> have devised a way for users to scan through the content of full movies
> quickly in a few seconds. When a user clicks the title frame of a movie, the
> window skips from one key frame to the next, making a rapid slide show, like
> a flip book of the movie. The abbreviated slide show visually summarizes a
> few-hour film in a few seconds. Expert software can be used to identify the
> key frames in a film in order to maximize the effectiveness of the summary."
