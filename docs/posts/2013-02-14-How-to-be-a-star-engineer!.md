We all want to be star engineers, right? Here's an intriguing article from
about ten years ago engineers from top companies helped to [dispel the myths
about star performers and uncover the surprising secrets of stellar
achievement for
engineers.](<http://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Research/Advice/star_engineer.pdf>):

> "In 1985, I was asked a series of questions, and have been tracking down
> their answers ever since. Bell Laboratories (then part of AT&T Corp. and now
> mostly belonging to Lucent Technologies Inc.) was perplexed. It hired the
> best and the brightest from the world's most prestigious universities, but
> only a few lived up to their apparent potential for brilliance. Most
> developed into solid performers of mostly average productivity who did not
> substantially further Bell Labs' contribution to AT&T's competitive
> advantage in the marketplace.
>
> What the labs wanted to know was: what separates the star from the average
> performer? Is it innate or can star performance be learned? Could a program
> to improve productivity be designed that would help turn average performers
> into stars?" ( **from** [How To Be A Star
