I just came across [this thoughtprovoking
](<http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000876.html>)bit called
**" How to be creative." **It's a quick read in the short form and at least
for me, hit home. [Here is an expanded form of the same
ideas](<http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html>), with
illustrations. **Recommended**.
