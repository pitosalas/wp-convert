>>

>> Here are two practical examples of how mainstream media ("MSM") sometimes
overlooks really interesting or engaging stories which are well covered online
(and I don't mean just blogs.) Have you seen these?

>>

>> Here's a really touching set of photos of Pope John Paul II shooing away
some doves who were released as a peace symbol at some event. I bet you never
saw that one. And wouldn't you have liked to see it somewhere, on TV, in the
newspaper?

>>

>> [How about this article?](<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6844293/>) It talks
about "Deep Throat", the secret source that gave Woodward and Bernstein key
information that led to the whole Watergate scandal being blown wide open:

>>

>>> "Key Watergate witness turned Deep Throat sleuth John Dean is standing by
his report in The Los Angeles Times that Bob Woodward has notified his masters
at The Washington Post that "Throat" is ill."

>>

>> Why isn't this covered anywhere else? Certainly a story of great interest
to many many Americans.

>>

>> My point? MSM can overlook some of the best, most interesting stories.
