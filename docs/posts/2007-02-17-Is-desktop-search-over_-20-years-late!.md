People are really crowing about Vista's new "instant serach" and how wonderful
it is and better than the old Windows XP Search functionality. Yeah I can't
disagree, but it's amazing how it's 20 years on before that glaring-glaring-
glaring hole in Windows was fixed. (And sure, Mac OS X has had Spotlight for a
while now, but I am not in love with it. I have only a decent amount of disk
space and a fast processor and a lot of memory, and I can't say it's fast. In
fact when I want to search for an email I always go into my browser and use
Google Mail's search feature…Anyway… Check out [this

previous Windows versions will be happy to hear that the Vista version is
fantastic, delivering near-instantaneous search results while providing the
types of advanced features that power users will simply drool over."
