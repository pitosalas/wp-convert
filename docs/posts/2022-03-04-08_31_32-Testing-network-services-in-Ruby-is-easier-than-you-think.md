[ Testing network services in Ruby is easier than you
think](<https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/testing-network-services-in-
ruby/>)

You’ve started a new project and it’s time for your code to depend on a third-
party service. It could be something like ElasticSearch, Resque, a billing
provider, or just an arbitrary HTTP API. You’re a good developer, so you want
this code to be well tested. But how do you test code that fires off requests
to a service that’s totally out of your control?
