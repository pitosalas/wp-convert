I stopped posting thoughts about the mess that all of congress has made of
health care reform. There are daily articles in the news to confirm the
dysfunction in government today. Here are key quotes two from today which
again hit home. I recommend that you read both articles in full:[Health Care
Letdown in the New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/opinion/16pewen.html>) and [The
Spirit of Sympathy in The New York
Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/opinion/16brooks.html>)

> "Three in four Americans say the health care system needs to be overhauled,
> and many provisions in the pending legislation have strong support. What’s
> more, the core of the Senate’s legislation closely resembles the very bill
> the Republicans offered in 1993 as an alternative to the Clinton plan. This
> makes clear that bipartisan reform was achievable, and indicts Congress for
> its failure to realize that goal with broad public support."(**from**
> [Health Care Letdown in the New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/opinion/16pewen.html>))

and

> "As a result of this sympathy and these sentiments, people are usually
> pretty decent to one another when they relate person to person. The odd
> thing is that when people relate group to group, none of this applies. When
> a group or a nation thinks about another group or nation, there doesn’t seem
> to be much natural sympathy, natural mimicry or a natural desire for
> attachment. It’s as if an entirely different part of the brain has been
> activated, utilizing a different mode of thinking." (**from** [The Spirit of
> Sympathy in The New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/opinion/16brooks.html>))
