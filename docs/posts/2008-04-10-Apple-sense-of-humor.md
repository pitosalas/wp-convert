Look closely at the dialog box on the right. It's Mac OS X info sheet for an
attached Windows computer. Now look even more closely at the simulated screen
on the image of an ugly big CRT monitor. See the
[BSOD](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death>)?

Who said they don't have a sense of humor?
