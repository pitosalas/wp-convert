>> I was talking about search engines [the other
day](</weblogs/archives/000805.html>). I guess Findory includes a search
engine, but in my mind it's a lot more. Here's how they describe it:

>>

>>> "Our patent-pending technology personalizes the homepage for each reader,
recommending content based on what they've read and what new content is being
published. We crawl through thousands of news and blogs articles so you don't
have to." ( **from** [About Findory](<http://www.findory.com/company/>))

>>

>> You have to play with it to get the idea. For me it's **especially handy**
to uncover other information that is **somehow related** to what I am writing
about in my own blog.

>>

>> For example, [here's the page on Findory that has the most recent posts in
my own blog](<http://www.findory.com/source?source=Pito's%20Blog&ib=1>). But
the really interesting stuff to me is "below the fold" where I can see other
information around the internet that relates to what I have written.

>>

>> Very very cool. **Recommended**!
