>> We are having another super-informal-geeky-but-not-exclusively-geeks **Geek
Dinner** , and we have a **lovely** new location, sponsored by our friends at
[Permabit](<http://www.permabit.com/>) (Thanks Tom and Katie!)

>>

>> Who is **we** , again? [Bela
Labovitch](<http://blogs.opml.org/BelaLabovitch>), [Adam
Green](<http://feedonomics.grazr.com/>) and me. We've organized two of these
this year, and they were lots-o-fun. People met, talked: no **cures for
cancer** were discovered but in general people felt it was good enough to try
again.

>>

>> What happens at these things? Just a lot of chatter about products,
technologies, politics and in general, "wats goin on" in the Boston area,
Geek-wise. Oh and of course, **food and drink** will be provided, NO CHARGE!

>>

>> Everyone is welcome, **and people who came last time** : invite along a
friend who didn't come or didn't know about it. **Really**! It would be nice
to have new faces.

>>

>> There's **no agenda**. We might go around and show off folks latest
creations, or not. Bring your **laptop** of you've got a demo you want to
show, bring **business cards** if you have them. But this is not primarily a
demo-rama, it's more of a network-o-rama.

>>

>> **See you there!**

>>

>> Here are the coordinates:

>>

>>> **When** : July 19, Wednesday, 6:30pm to 9:30pm

>>>

>>> **Where** : Permabit, 25 First Street, 2nd Floor. Across from the Galleria
Mall.

>>>

>>> **Topics of discussion:** AJAXPHPOPMLRSSJAVAETC
