[ GPT in 60 Lines of NumPy | Jay Mody](< https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-
scratch/>) â€“Implementing a GPT model from scratch in NumPy. This is a detailed
article including python source code. Ive skimmed it and it does explain a
lot. But even without my being a neural net, ai, machine learning, gpt,
chatgpt expert, i think i would learn a lot. Also the article is very well
written presented.
