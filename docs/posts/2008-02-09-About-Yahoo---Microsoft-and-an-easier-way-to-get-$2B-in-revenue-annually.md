You can read all about the potential acquisition of Yahoo by Microsoft, here
for example, where Marc Andreessen writes:

> "I think that a Microsoft/Yahoo merger would have practically no impact on

> valley.html>))

You should read his whole paper to get his 5 point argument. And I definitely
agree with this conclusion:

> "Build something of value -- something that people want, and something that
> will be profitable at the appropriate point -- and the world is yours.
> [snipâ€¦]

> Or, reduced to a phrase: _the best way to get bought is to not be for sale._
> " (**from** [Silicon Valley after a Microsoft/Yahoo
> merger](<http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/02/silicon-valley.html>))

_Good stuff_ , especially that last conclusion.

Personally, I am shorting both Microsoft AND Yahoo.

I predict that the 'integration' (a word used very loosely) will give both
Microsoft and Yahoo a huge amount of indigestion because I think it's
basically not possible.

The expected 'leverage' and 'reduction of duplication' will actually be an
extended period of executive and **strategic distraction** , **loss** of the
best people at Yahoo, and in the end, **nothing**.

I think **Microsoft would do better** putting those $40+ Billion in the bank
and get a nice $2,000 million revenue stream annually, forever.
