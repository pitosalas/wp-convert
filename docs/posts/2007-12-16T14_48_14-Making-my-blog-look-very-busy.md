Timestamp](https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/wp-
content/uploads/imagewell//timestamp.jpg?w=584)Have you noticed? How
frequently I've been posting?

I am using WordPress's 'post in the future' feature so in one sitting I can
rattle off 6 or 7 posts (for example I am writing this one on December 8) and
schedule them for publication in the coming days.

Very efficient ðŸ™‚
