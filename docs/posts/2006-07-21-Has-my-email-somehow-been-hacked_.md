>> Ok, oh wise listeners out there. Here's what's happened to me twice now in
the last week.

>>

>> Basically I receive a large number of email bounce messages which were sent
'from' xxx@blogbridge.com, where I never heard of xxx. And there are a ton of
different xxx's. When I say a large number, it's around 100 of them. None of
them actually exist.

>>

>> So what are the theories?

>>

>>   * someone is sending out spam using email addresses that simply textually
look like accounts on blogbridge.com. Is that even possible? I can't think of
any reason why one couldn't gen up fake return addresses, and when emails
bounce, that's where they bounce to.

>>

>>   * somehow my email (SMTP) server is hijacked or compromised? But why
would the return addresses appear to be blogbridge.com?

>>

>>   * somehow my server has been fooled into sending out a bunch of emails? I
don't understand how.

>>

>>

>>

>> So, what do I do? Any advice/explanations/hints would be appreciated!
