Chris Shipley of Guidewire Group has a [great post bemoaning how entrepreneurs
are driven to invest their time and energy and (other peoples' money) on more
and more vacuous projects:](<http://guidewiregroup.com/2011/11/make-it-

Personally I totally agree with the sentiment. Are we bemoaning capitalism?
Does that make us communists, oh dear? I don't know - it's true that these
entrepreneurs are pursuing their dream of making it big as expected from
rational economic actors. If we as a society chose to reward - with our
attention, time and money - vacuous projects, then in a way, aren't we getting
what we asked for?

Analogous I suppose to my thoughts about TV. Isn't TV (and especially Cable)
news terrible, repetitive, overly polarized, superficial and everything else?
I doubt (Murdoch may be the exception) that folks deciding what to put on
Cable have any other agenda than simply: "measure what brings in viewers and
give them more of that. If it doesn't work then try something else.)

What we asked for.
