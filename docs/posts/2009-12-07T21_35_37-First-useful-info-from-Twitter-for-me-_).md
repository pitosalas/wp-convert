After sending an email to [Terroir Coffee](<http://www.terroircoffee.com/>)
asking them to explain the roastiness terminology that they use for all their
coffee. It's obscure and not mentioned on the web site. No response.

I happened to note that [George Howell, who is their CEO and
visionary](<http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-13642-Coffee-
Examiner%7Ey2009m6d18-George-Howell-and-the-Cup-of-Excellence>) was tweeting.
So I posted the question to him on twitter for all the world to see, and lo-
and-behold, I got an answer.

Maybe I should try the same technique for the
[Mint.com](<http://www.mint.com>) question I don't seem to be getting a decent
answer to.

Prediction: this model of customer service doesn't scale. As soon as the
novelty wears off, Twitter as a way for the CEO to 'stay in touch with the
little people' will fall by the wayside. I mean where's Jeff Bezos on Twitter?
