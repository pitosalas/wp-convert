**Link: [Camels and Rubber Duckies - Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html):** "One of the biggest questions you're going to be asking now is, "How much should I charge for my software?" When you ask the experts they don't seem to know. Pricing is a deep, dark mystery, they tell you. The biggest mistake software companies make is charging too little, so they don't get enough income, and they have to go out of business."
