[Adam Green](<//www.darwinianweb.com/>) has two very insightful posts about
Mashups inspired at [Mashup Camp](<http://www.mashupcamp.com/>):

>>

>>> All of this is very cool. At least that is what one side of my brain says.
The other side is saying "How the hell is the average person going to
understand any of this?" I even doubt if the average blogger is going to be
able to follow all of this data flying around the Internet. (from "[Cognitive
dissonance at Mashup
Camp](<http://mashup.darwinianweb.com/archive/2006/25.html>)")

>>

>> and also about business models in the new world of Mashups:

>>

>>> "At the end of his pitch we had a standard joke. "Do we pay them or do
they pay us?" These conversations were going on in board rooms all over the
country" (from "[Who pays whom](<http://mashup.darwinianweb.com/>)?")

>> [Read them](<http://mashup.darwinianweb.com/archive/2006/25.html>)
[both](<http://mashup.darwinianweb.com/>). Good stuff.  By the way this stuff
is somewhat relevant to [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com/>), even
though it's [not your conventional
mashup](<http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2006/01/blogbridge_as_a.php>), if
you think about it BlogBridge, and it's relationship to the BlogBridge
Service, and other services such as del.icio.us and Technorati raise [very
similar
questions.](<http://www.blogbridge.com/archives/2006/01/blogbridge_as_a.php>)
Technorati Tags: [mashup](<http://www.technorati.com/tag/mashup>),
