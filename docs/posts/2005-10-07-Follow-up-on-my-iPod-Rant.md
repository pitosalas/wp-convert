>> After [my rant a few days ago](</weblogs/archives/000891.php>) about the
**quality** of new-fangled electronic **gizmos** I got various emails. Most
interesting was [this
link](<http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/mailbox-20051006.html>) to Walt Mossberg's
comments about the scratching of the iPod nano's, where he says:

>>

>>> "If I were reviewing the nano today, I would still call it "the best
combination of beauty and functionality of any music player I've tested," as I
did in my review. But I would include a strong, prominent, warning that it
scratches too easily in normal usage. This is a real downside to an otherwise
excellent product." ( **from** [Mossberg's
Mailbox](<http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/mailbox-20051006.html>))

>>

>> I **can 't claim** that my rant caused Walt to write this clarification,
but it **sure is timely**. I haven't bought my nano yet, so I am going to
wait, at least for a few weeks, to see what happens.

>>

>> One of the emails also pointed me to [this David Pogue Video
commentary](<http://www.nytimes.com/video/html/2005/09/15/technology/highbandwidth/windowsmedia/20050915_POGUE_VIDEO.html>)
on the nano. Funny.
