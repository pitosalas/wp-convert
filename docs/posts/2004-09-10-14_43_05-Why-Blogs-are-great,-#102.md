>> I am often asked **what 's so special about blogging**. I always answer,
technically it's pretty simple, so that's not it. It's that there are people
in the world, who for their own reasons have chosen to write down their
thoughts and opinion. I learn things that I would **never have learned**
otherwise from blogs.

>> Here's the **latest example**. Now I am not a Bushie - by any stretch of
the **imagination** , and I haven't bothered checking the credibility of [this
post](<http://www.hughhewitt.com/#postid874>).

>> [But I find it a fascinating discussion of the analysis that is leading
some to question the authenticity of certain documents that are **purportedly
showing that Bush had problems** with his superiors in the National Guard back
in 1972.](<http://www.hughhewitt.com/#postid874>)

>> I had not heard or seen this before. An interesting perspective. **That 's
why blogs are great!**
