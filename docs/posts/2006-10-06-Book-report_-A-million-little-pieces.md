> I don't know if you followed the spat a few months ago. This [book, "A
> million little pieces" by James Frey](<http://www.amazon.com/Million-Little-
> Pieces-James-Frey/dp/0307276902>) was chosen by Ms. "O" (Oprah) for her book
> club. A lot of fanfare, a lot of press. It's a memoir about one man's
> experiences as a totally out of control addict, then joining a rehab program
> and getting on the road to recovery.
>
> The problem is / was that after Oprah made all this fuss about James Frey,
> it [turned out that certain details of the book were
> fictionalized](<http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0104061jamesfrey1.html>).
> It was not exactly clear whether 10%, 20% or what were not from his real
> life experience. But
> [Oprah](<http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/01/11/frey.lkl/>) threw a fit
> in a famous '[come to
> Oprah](<http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200601/tows_past_20060126.jhtml>)'
> episode where she publicly berated and humiliated James Frey for misleading
> Her and making her stake her reputation on a true life story which turned
> out not to be 100% true. It was good TV, but an unpleasant affair to watch.
> Even [Wikipedia got into the
> act!](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces>)
>
> Well I finally got around to reading this book. It is excellent,
> outstanding, informative, dramatic, well written and compelling. Frankly it
> matters not a wit whether it's 100% true or not. It was instructive to
> actually read the object of Oprah's wrath because from hearing and reading
> **about it** , you'd easily bypass the book and not read it. I really
> **recommend it!
