[ What Can We Learn from Barnes & Noble's Surprising Turnaround?](<
https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/what-can-we-learn-from-barnes-and>) –I was in
a Barnes and Nobel again after many years. Actually many years before that I
would go to a B&N more than once a week. Then between Amazon and terrible
inventories at B&N and Kindle and Nook I stopped going. Then a few weeks ago I
visited one and it was a revelation. I had a great time browsing books and
books and books. Great article:"Digital platforms are struggling, meanwhile a
136-year-old book retailer is growing again. But why?"
