Here's a tiny social conundrum. When someone writes you, calls you and leave a
message, calls and doesn't, or even texts you, what is your obligation to
respond? If the question is "are you free for lunch today" and you know you
are not, is it OK to just not answer? If the question is "have you seen
this?."

This seems to come up, and different people and different communities seem to
have different rules about this. So before you take offense at the lack of
response, consider that it might just be a different social protocol that you
may not necessarily adhere to!

I've had that happen, though, when leaving several emails or support tickets
with services that I use. What do you make of a lack of response? Sometimes I
imagine that they are so close to going out of business that responding to
emails has become a low priority. Then on the other hand, I am the
support@blogbridge.com, and do I always answer all emails that come in? Almost
all, but I have to admit that occasionally I've just left an email gone
unanswered.

There's this idea of "lifetime value of a customer". If I could predict the
future and how much this customer will eventually spend on my business, I can
compare that to the cost of servicing them and decide that actually they are
going to lose me money and essentially "fire the customer." Of course there
are the 'externalities' to such a decision, like developing the reputation of
being a business that's hard to live with.
