**Link: [Article: Tailwind is a Leaky Abstraction](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/tailwind-is-a-leaky-abstraction/):** "Programmers love abstracting things. Hey, i keep writing the same sequence, let me create a language on top of this language to make things easier. Ive never liked nor bothered learning SCSS and SASS. For that reason. I figured that one way ot the other id stil end up in CSS.  The same seems to be true of tailwind!"
