[ Article: Tailwind is a Leaky Abstraction](<
https://jakelazaroff.com/words/tailwind-is-a-leaky-abstraction/>) â€“Programmers
love abstracting things. Hey, i keep writing the same sequence, let me create
a language on top of this language to make things easier. Ive never liked nor
bothered learning SCSS and SASS. For that reason. I figured that one way ot
the other id stil end up in CSS. The same seems to be true of tailwind!
