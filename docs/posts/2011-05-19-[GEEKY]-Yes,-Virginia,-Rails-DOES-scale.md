# [[GEEKY] Yes, Virginia, Rails DOES scale](None)




Why doesn't every one **love Rails**? I am surprised when I run into someone
(Pat?) who's not so sure about Rails. Usually it's about scalability.

[I warned you this is a geeky post]

When I am designing or building a system and am questioned about whether
**writing it in Ruby or Rails is a good idea.** Or if someone asks me my
opinion or for advice about whether it makes sense that his or her developers
are recommending Rails for a big site.

What I believe is that scalability has to do with the overall **system
architecture** -- caching, queueing, horizontal scalability and so on. It does
not have to do with the programming language. (What the LivingSocial guy said
about this wasn't quite as polite - he said "get better developers!!!")

I am at this conference, RailsConf, overflowing with hard-core Rails fanatics,
so the sample is admittedly biased. But I did pick up some **fact-based
tidbits**.

Did you know that two of the biggest web sites out there today are built
totally on Rails? And I don't mean Twitter. No,
[LivingSocial.com](<http://www.livingsocial.com>) and
[Groupon.com](<http://www.groupon.com>). Both huge. Both perform beautifully.
Both written totally in Rails.

'Nuf said?

# **railsconf** -- What, can't I use hashtags in a blog post?
