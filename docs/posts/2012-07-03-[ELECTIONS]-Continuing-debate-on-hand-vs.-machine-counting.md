Just from today's New York Times:

> "Voters in New York State use a vote-scanning system that can tally votes
> swiftly and, in most cases, correctly. Not New York City. The cityâ€™s Board
> of Elections uses a **creaky system of counting by hand** that is prone to
> **embarrassing errors** on election night." ( **from** [Why Can't NYC Count
> Votes?](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/opinion/why-cant-new-york-city-
> count-votes.html>))
