If you are a theatre fan I strongly recommend a play I just saw last night.
It's called "Luck of the Irish". From a [review on
Boston.com:](<http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-13/arts/31325980_1_white-
couple-black-homebuyers-lucy>)

> "… It's one of numerous instances in Greenidge's superb, beautifully
> realized new play -- now receiving its premiere in a Huntington Theatre
> Company production directed by Melia Bensussen -- that illustrate the
> playwright's sure grasp of the nuances of race and class and her insights
> into the complexities of human nature." (**from**

Run, don't walk to see this [play at the Huntington Theatre in
Boston!](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/2011-2012/The-Luck-of-the-
