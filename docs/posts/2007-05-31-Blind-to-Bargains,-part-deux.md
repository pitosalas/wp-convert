I follow [Chris Pirillo's blog](<http://chris.pirillo.com/>) and other
writings religiously. Two recent, contrasting posts really caught my eye
because I think they reflect the popular bias against software. That is,
people are glad to pay a lot for hardware gadgets at the same time as they
feel really unhappy about paying even a pittance for software.

Today, in ["I Purchased an Optimus Maximums keyboard", Chris
says:](<http://chris.pirillo.com/2007/05/31/i-purchased-an-optimus-maximus-
keyboard/>)

> 'No matter, I’ve placed an order for what will likely be known as the most
> expensive keyboard in the history of the world.
>
> “Why?!”
>
> I keep asking myself the same question.' ([from the Chris Pirillo
> Blog](<http://chris.pirillo.com/2007/05/31/i-purchased-an-optimus-maximus-
> keyboard/>))

But just yesterday, in ["Free Software vs Free Trial", Chris
wrote:](<http://chris.pirillo.com/2007/05/30/free-software-vs-free-trial/>)

> "Either way, subsequent licenses should be at *LEAST* half off (if not

If you are a reader of this blog you know that this is a question that I've
pondered on and off for a long time. Here's one bit I wrote last year called
"We make it up in voiume", where I said:

> "I’ve written about this, and have spoken many times about it: Why do we all

(I am not the only one to notice. Jeremy Wagstaff of the Wall Street Journal
has pondered it too in ["Blind to Bargains".)](</2007/04/28/blind-to-bargains-
