Over the last 2 weeks I've been actually able to carve out some quality time
to get my head around Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

My play project is something called myscum.org, which is a lightweight scrum
tracking tool. Basically it's modeled after what I've been using for
BlogBridge, working with Aleksey. So a pretty simple case, makes a decent play
project.

But of course, that's how BlogBridge started. A decent play projectâ€¦
