>> [OPML Camp](<http://www.opmlcamp.com/>) was yesterday and today, so it's
over now. We had **good attendance** and some really **good discussions** and
interesting demos. Here are some highlights:

>>

>>   * We talked about tools, both brand new, not yet written, and existing

>>

>>   * These tools do all kinds of interesting OPML related processing

>>

>>   * [Grazr](<http://www.grazr.com/>) - A really cool web page widget to
view and traverse an OPML structure

>>

>>   * [OPMLSearch](<http://www.opmlsearch.com/>) - Google for OPML files
across the web

>>

>>   * [OPML Workstation](<http://www.opmlworkstation.com/>) - A library of
OPML files, plus an editor to create and edit them

>>

>>   * [OPML Editor](<http://support.opml.org/>) - Another tool for editing
and hosting OPML structures, and publishing them

>>

>>   * [iJot](<http://www.ijot.net/>) - Another tool for editing and hosting
OPML, and publishing them

>>

>>   * [Attensa](<http://www.attensa.com/>) - A web based, attention-oriented
feed aggregator

>>

>>   * Adam Green [really cool

([here's the
result](<http://mashup.darwinianweb.com/projects/tmblogs/tmopml.xml>))

>>

>>   * We talked about [OPML 2.0 ](<http://www.opml.org/>)and what is new
there

>>

>>   * We talked about the role of namespaces in extending XML and OPML

>>

>>   * We talked about RSS namespaces that exist. Mike Kowalchick showed a
really [interesting analysis of the
RSS](<http://www.grazr.com/mikepk/namespace.png>) namespaces that appear 'in
the wild' ([watch his blog](<http://blog.grazr.com/>) for more details)

>>

>>   * We talked about RDF and tried to figure out it's relationship to OPML

>>

>>

>>

>> It was a very **useful** and **enjoyable** meeting. Sorry you missed it!
