An interesting fact:

> "In the last years of the nineteenth century, Charles Dow created an index
> of 12 leading industrial companies. Almost none of them exist today….[…]…
> Four years after Dow invented his average, a group of 14 leading research
> institutions created the Association of American Universities. All of them
> exist today." ( **from**[The Higher Education Monopoly is Crumbling As We

> accreditation-MIT-university>)

The article goes on to talk about where Higher Ed's staying power has come
from:

> "I think that rule is going to change, and soon. Many factors explain the
> endurance of higher education institutions—the ascent of the knowledge
> economy, their crucial role in upper-middle class acculturation, our
> peculiar national enthusiasm for college sports—but the single greatest
> asset held by traditional colleges and universities is their exclusive
> franchise for the production and sale of higher education credentials. (

> accreditation-MIT-university>)

The question arises: how long will those credentials continue to be worth so
much money? Every day we read in the paper about a new educational
entrepreneur ([yours truly included)](<http://www.webbootup.com/>) who wants
to offer valuable and relevant educational opportunities outside the
University walls, to bring it to a wider and underserved cohort, and for a
more realistic cost.

I love teaching at Brandeis University and hope to continue doing it for a
long while to come. At the same time I believe there is a major unmet demand
from Computer Science students and career changers for a super intense
introduction to what I like to call Applied Computer Science, with a strong
focus on **doing** and **building products**. I feel that what we are trying
to achieve is a clear part of the trends covered in [The Higher Education
Monopoly is Crumbling As We
