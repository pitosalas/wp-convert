CI045_noonan_D_20080912160135.jpg?resize=155%2C102)I've been a [Peggy
Noonan](<http://online.wsj.com/public/page/peggy-noonan.html>) fan for a
while. Yes she is politically more conservative than I am, but she is such a
literate writer it is always a pleasure to [read her
stuff](<http://www.peggynoonan.com/archive.php?archive=2>). Here are some
recent good ones:

[Palin's Failin' - "At any rate, come and get me,
copper."](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122419210832542317.html>)

[Playing Frisbee on a Precipice - "With regard to the continuing saga of our
vice presidential candidates, I think it was a strategic mistake to send Sarah
Palin out on the stump as warrior girl."  
](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122359863551021415.html>)  
[Palin and Populism - "She killed. She had him at "Nice to meet you. Hey can I
call you Joe?"](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122300786229301597.html>)

Anyway, [they are always
great](<http://online.wsj.com/search/aggregate.html?article-doc-
type=%7BDeclarations%7D>), even when I don't agree with her.
