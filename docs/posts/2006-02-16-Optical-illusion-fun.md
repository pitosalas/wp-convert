>> I got this in an email, not sure exactly where it came from but it's pretty
cool. The image looks like it's moving, doesn't it? But actually it's not an
animation at all. It's your brain that getting its circuits scrambled. You
know how you can tell? Just cover most of the image with your hands and look
at a small part. It doesn't move. Amusing!
