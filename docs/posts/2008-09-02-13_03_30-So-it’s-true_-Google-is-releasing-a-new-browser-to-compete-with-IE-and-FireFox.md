interesting commentary:

> "If you're thinking about "Chrome" as just another web browser, you're
> missing the larger point. Chrome will no doubt function just fine as a
> browser, giving you yet another icon choice to add to your browser
> collection alongside IE, Firefox, and Safari. It will also likely include
> some whizbang new features that force Microsoft and Mozilla to immediately
> retool their own offerings. But that's almost beside the point." ( **from**
