Recently I wanted to get feedback on one of several ideas for the design of
the new [BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com/>) web site. I had selected 6
product web sites that had a nice look and wanted to somehow visually compare
them. Here are two free tools I used:

  * [Papparazzi](<http://derailer.org/paparazzi/>)! is a free Mac utility that does one thing and does it well. It makes a screen shot from a URL of a web site, importantly, including the whole page not just the part that is visible without scrolling.
  * [Pintrest](<http://pinterest.com/>) is a free web site that facilitates sharing of images of things. Kind of like a delicious for images … or something. It's kind of hard to describe which is why I had not used it before. But this was a perfect use of it.

With those two free tools, I was able to create [this web page
](<http://pinterest.com/pitosalas/blogbridge-web-site-ideas/>)allowing the
quick and easy comparison of the [possible designs of the new BlogBridge web
site](<http://pinterest.com/pitosalas/blogbridge-web-site-ideas/>).

Oh and if you care to, please weigh in on the design you like the best 🙂
