**Link: [Transformer models: an introduction and catalog — 2023 Edition](https://amatriain.net/blog/transformer-models-an-introduction-and-catalog-2d1e9039f376/?utm_source=abyteofcodingnewsletter):** "Author" "I have a terrible memory for names. In the past few years we have seen the meteoric appearance of dozens of models of the Transformer family, all of which have funny, but not self-explanatory, names. The goal of this post is to offer a short and simple catalog and classification of the most popular Transformer models. In other words, I needed a Transformers cheat-sheet and couldn’t find a good enough one online, so I thought I’d write my own. I hope it can be useful to you too""
