(**Web site except:** An interesting article, stating the obvious. This is highly relevant to someone who teaches college students their in their very first year of learning programming. And yet it is still a subject of debate among my colleagues. Heres the authors’s own words: “t's not necessarily about what programming language you learn or use. It's about how you approach problem solving.”)
