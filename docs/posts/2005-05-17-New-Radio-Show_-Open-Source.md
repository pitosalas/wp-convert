>> Welcome back [Chris
Lydon](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon>)! Those of you who
have lived in the Boston area for a while (and who are NPR listeners) will
recognize the name. Chris has been on local and national TV and radio, and a
couple of years ago did some really early, innovative podcasting work
([yes](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting>), [before Adam
Curry](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/14#When:8:02:28AM>) ðŸ™‚

>> Anyway, he is launching a new radio show, called "Open Source", and he is
**debugging** it in public, which is **pretty cool**! [Check out the show's
blog](<http://www.radioopensource.org/>) for background and also links to the
first three beta test shows. **They 're great!**

>>

>> Amusingly the latest show on his site is about Wikipedia (of which I am a
huge fan) and this is [Wikipedia's entry about
Chris](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lydon>)! ( _Wheels within
wheels_!)
