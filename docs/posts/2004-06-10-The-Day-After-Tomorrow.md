>> Occassionally, I will have either an incredibly **positive** or
**negative** reaction to a book, play or movie and I will be moved, who knows
why, to write a bit about it here. Well, I just saw ["The Day After Tomorrow"
](<http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/dayaftertomorrow/>)and it is **totally
lame**. Yes the special effects are impressive, but the story, the dialog, the
way the characters react, is so stilted, so ridiculous, that it annoyed me
after 5 minutes in the movie.

>> And I am **not objecting** on scientific grounds. I don't know enough about
the science to judge whether or not its realistic, semi-plausible, or totally
nutty, but I am willing to suspend disbelief. And by the way, about the
special effects: why do these folks standing around in sub zero temparatures
in street not even **look** cold?
