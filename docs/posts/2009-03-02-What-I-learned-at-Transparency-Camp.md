There are people in our government who are **strongly pushing** for more
openness and who are very focused on delivering better, more modern, service
to citizens. They operate under some **severe constraints** , in some cases
from rules and regulations that seem to have become **obsolete**. Yet you can
see where these rules came from and also see the difficulty in just deciding
not to follow them.

This paper, "[Barriers and Solutions to Implementing Social Media in
Government](<http://www.usa.gov/webcontent/about/documents.shtml#barriers>)"
is **lauded** by many at [Transparency Camp](<http://transparencycamp.org/>)
is a very important contribution. Here's the kind of thing it covers:

> "As the new Administration looks to leverage these new tools to create a
> more effective and transparent government, it’s an opportune time for us to
> share what we’ve learned and propose solutions for how to best use these new
> tools across government. These recommendations are based on our first-hand
> experience using social media within our own agencies and from hundreds of
> conversations with web managers across the country." ( **from** "[Barriers
> and Potential
> Solutions](<http://www.usa.gov/webcontent/documents/SocialMediaFed%20Govt_BarriersPotentialSolutions.pdf>)")

Another piece which has been mentioned and **greatly admired** is the
"[Memorandum on Transparency and Open
Government](<http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/>)"
issued by the White House in January 2009. It's short, and worth **reading in
its entirety**. But here's the opening paragraph:

> "My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of
> openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and
> establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.
> Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and
> effectiveness in Government." (from [Memorandum on Transparency and Open
> Government](<http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment/>))
