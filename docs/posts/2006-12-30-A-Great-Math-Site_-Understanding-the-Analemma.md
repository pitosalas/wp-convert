>> The analemma is the apparent path that the sun takes in the sky during  
>  the year. If you record the precise position of the sun at the same  
>  time every day, instead of being in exactly the same place every day,  
>  it will traverse a figure eight, like in this image. This is an effect  
>  caused by a combination of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, and  
>  the tilt of the earth's axis. It can be a bit hard to visualize just  
>  where the figure-eight shape comes from; the analemma site uses a  
>  combination of diagrams and animations to make it extremely clear, and  
>  works through the entire process of demonstrating where each component  
>  of the analemma comes from, and deriving the equations that describe  
>  it. [Read
