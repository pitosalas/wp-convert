>> Just a quick note about what's up with BlogBridge. My time has been
severely drained by a new consulting project, so progress has slowed down more
than I would like. The last while I was knee-deep in installation, deployment,
upgrade facilities. I looked at a bunch of possible ways of
distributing,installing and then upgrading the application, evaluating 3 of
them in detail. What a mess!

>>

>> In the end I settled on Java Web Start. I used to think of this as a bit of
a kludge, but it seems to be well suited to deployment and installation of
Java apps, and with each release Sun seems to make it a little nicer. So
that's what I am going with.

>>

>> I've learned far more than I ever wanted to know about the CLASSPATH, Jars,
JNLP, and yada-yada-yada. Interesting though, but definitely heavy duty
geekosity.

>>

>> BlogBridge is still in what I would generously call a pre-alpha state. Not
really usable. (FeedDemon is much better.) If a few people would like to try
out the Java Web Start deployment, send me an email and we can talk.
