>> I saw this in the Wall Street Journal:

>>

>>> "Marcos Weskamp, a 27-year-old Web designer in Tokyo, created a graphical
interface1 for Google News as a way to see how much attention is given to
individual stories. A headline that has appeared in several publications is
represented by a large box, while a story that is less widely covered shows up
as a smaller square. The boxes are grouped by color into categories like
business and entertainment." - Wall Street Journal, subscription needed.

>> What a totally cool idea, and beautifully implemented!
