>> I'm a big coffee drinker, ok? I've been putting [my
Keurig](<http://www.keurig.com/B50.asp?mscsid=JT5G4FGRFQFE9MS776CMNW8RE681124E>)
single serving machine through it's paces for the last few months and I really
like it. I've already spent more on little coffee pods from Keurig than the
machine ever cost. Another post will go into what I've learned from that.

>>

>> Recently though I've gotten enamored of short non-fat Lattes at
[Starbucks](<http://www.starbucks.com/default.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1>). That's a
story in and of itself, which again will wait for another post.

>>

>> The real story is that I just unpacked my new [Capresso Ultima semi-
automatic espresso maker](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html>).
Check it out [here](<http://www.capresso.com/prod_esp_ultima.html>).

>> I've already made too many espressos, capucinnos and lattes, luckily many
of them decaf. I **really like** this machine.

>>

>> Semi-automatic means that while you need to feed it ground coffee (i.e. it
doesn't include a grinder) it does do everything else itself. Tamping is done
semi-automatically, through a very simple use of your own muscle power. The
used grinds go into a little compartment for emptying after a bunch of uses.

>>

>> And, the coffee is del.icio.us!

>>

>> I will be posting further observations of my experiences in the near
future:

>>

>>   * [What are the trade-offs that led me to this particular
machine?](</weblogs/archives/001146.php>)

>>

>>   * How does it compare to the Keurig and does one replace the other?

>>

>>   * [What have I learned so far about the kind of grind that
works?](</weblogs/archives/001145.php>)

>>

>>   * How hard is it to steam or foam milk?

>>

>>   * What is the difference between a latte and a capucinno and why do I
prefer lattes?

>>

>>   * What's up with Starbucks short non-Fat Lattes?

>>

>>   * What are the comparative costs of operation

>>

>> Hey, sounds like I am writing a book!
