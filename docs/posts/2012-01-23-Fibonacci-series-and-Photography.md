# [Fibonacci series and Photography](None)




You can't be a self-respecting computer or science geek and not have heard
about the Fibonacci series. You know, 1-1-2-3-5-8… etc. How about Fibonacci's
Ratio? How about the Golden Mean or the Divine Proportion? Not sure, right?

Fibonacci, and its role in art, design and photography is a little less well
known. As I continue to study photography and art I came across this excellent
article about that very topic:

> "Hopefully, this article has shed some light on a somewhat mysterious
> subject in the world of photography. Fibonacci's Ratio is a powerful tool
> for composing your photographs, and it should't be dismissed as a minor
> difference from the rule of thirds.

> While the grids look similar, using Phi can sometimes mean the difference
> between a photo that just clicks, and one that does't quite feel right.
> I'm certainly not saying that the rule of thirds doesn't have a place in
> photography, but Phi is a far superior and much more intelligent and
> historically proven method for composing a scene." ( **from**[ Divine
