I've seen **Path** , the new "un social" network (limit 50 friends) plugged by
pundits and journalists. I tried it and **just didn 't get it**. Didn't know
what it was for, who it was for, and **why it was getting attention**. So I am
glad finally to come across a commentator who seems to agree with me… Check
this post [Path Adds 10-Second Video to its Anti-Social
Network](<http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Mashable/~3/RHgt9Z--SQc/>) from
[Mashable!](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/mashable>):

> Ultimately, Path appears to value style over function with an overwrought
