been [saying something like this since a week after
9/11](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/opinion/22friedman.html>). I agreed
with him then, and I still agree with him:

> "Oil is poisoning our climate and our geopolitics, and here is how we’re
> going to break our addiction: We’re going to set a floor price of $4.50 a
> gallon for gasoline and $100 a barrel for oil. And that floor price is going
> to trigger massive investments in renewable energy — particularly wind,
> solar panels and solar thermal. And we’re also going to go on a crash
> program to dramatically increase energy efficiency, to drive conservation to
> a whole new level and to build more nuclear power. And I want every Democrat
> and every Republican to join me in this endeavor.”

> That’s what a real president would do." (from [Mr. Bush, Lead or
> Leave](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/opinion/22friedman.html>))
