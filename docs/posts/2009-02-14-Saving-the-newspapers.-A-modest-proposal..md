**Link: [Saving the newspapers. A modest proposal.](None):** ""

![](https://i0.wp.com/img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/2009/1101090216_400.jpg?resize=200%2C265)You
know I am a fan of the Newspapers. I've written about it several times,
[wondering out loud whether our collective desire to get everything for
cheaper and cheaper, eventually for free, would eventually kill
them.](</2009/01/29/going-going-gone/>) This topic has been [discussed a lot
in the
press](<http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191,00.html>) and
blogs as well.

What if we apply the **principles of viral marketing** to supporting
newspapers?

How would that work?

What if a paid subscriber of newspaper N is offered the following: For each of
your friends who you get to sign up for a subscription, you (personA) get
something off every issue that you receive, as do they (personB).

As long as PersonB subscribes, they both get a small **bounty**. Furthermore,
this work down the line, for every subscriber that PersonB signs up, they
(PersonC) as well as PersonB get a small bounty. And PersonA gets a smaller
**bounty**.

**Some details** need to be worked out ðŸ™‚ In particular the financial model.
The mathematics are not that hard and we could work out how big a bounty could
be sustained under various assumptions. I think it could work.

The **beauty** is that this is a combined marketing/circulation program which
could be implemented by the paper itself without creating complicated new
agencies, non profits, or NGOs.

Maybe this idea is not the one, but **does it inspire others**? What, you say
this **idea isn 't original**? **Sorry!**. With everything and everyone
blogging each idea that pops into their head (yours truly included) it's hard
to know what's original!
