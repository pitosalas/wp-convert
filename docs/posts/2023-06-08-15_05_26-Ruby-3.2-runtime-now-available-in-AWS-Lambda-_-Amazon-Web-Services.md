Really interesting article about now to use Ruby with AWS Lambda.in addition a very useful review of "modern" Ruby features.

(**Web site except:** Get started building with Ruby 3.2 today by making necessary changes for compatibility with Ruby 3.2, and specifying a runtime parameter value of ruby3.2 when creating or updating your Lambda functions.)
