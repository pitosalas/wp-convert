In my work with the [Open Source Digital Voting
foundation](<http://www.osdv.org>), and
[TrustTheVote](<www.trustthevote.org>), I just learned two new words, for your
educational pleasure:

"[COTS" - Commercial off the
shelf](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf>)  
"[COTS" - Government off the
shelf](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_off-the-shelf>)

Ok, not all the posts here are gems, but it is also my personal memory bank ðŸ™‚
