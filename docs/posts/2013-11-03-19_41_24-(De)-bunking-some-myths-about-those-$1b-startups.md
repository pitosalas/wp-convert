I want to direct your attention ton interesting article about $1 Billion
Startups - "Unicorns" - on TechCrunch today. Some myths debunked and others
confirmed:

> So, we wondered, as we're a year into our new fund (which doesn't need to
> back billion-dollar companies to succeed, but hey, we like to learn): how
> likely is it for a startup to achieve a billion-dollar valuation? Is there
> anything we can learn from the mega hits of the past decade, like Facebook,
> LinkedIn and Workday? ( **from:** [Welcome To The Unicorn Club: Learning
> From Billion-Dollar Startups |
> TechCrunch](<http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-
> club/>)🙂
