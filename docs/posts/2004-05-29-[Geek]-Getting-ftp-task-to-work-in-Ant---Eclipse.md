Note to self:

>>

>> The FTP task in Ant relies on the library: **commons-net.jar from Apache**.

>>

>> Be not confused, this is different from the library: **ant-commons-
net.jar** , which I believe is the Ant interface to commons-net.jar.

>>

>> In other words, you need them both, in ant_homelib. If they are not both
there you can a ridiculously cryptic error message.

> p.s. Didn 't I say "GEEK" ?**Dave, thanks for the words of encouragement.
