One of the [lessons that Guy Kawasaki learned from Steve
Jobs](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2011/10/what-i-learned-from-steve-
jobs.html#axzz1h7dQ0xtj>), which really rings true to me:

> "Experts are clueless. Experts -- journalists, analysts, consultants,
> bankers, and gurus can't  **do**  so they **advise**.
>
> They can tell you what is wrong with your product, but they **cannot make a
> great one.**
>
> They can tell you how to sell something, but they cannot sell it themselves.
> They can tell you how to create great teams, but they only manage a
> secretary.
>
> For example, the experts told us that the two biggest shortcomings of
> Macintosh in the mid 1980s was the lack of a daisy-wheel printer driver and
> Lotus 1-2-3; another advice gem from the experts was to buy Compaq. Hear
> what experts say, but donât always listen to them." ( **from** [How To
> Change The World](<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2011/10/what-i-learned-from-
> steve-jobs.html#axzz1h7dQ0xtj>))
