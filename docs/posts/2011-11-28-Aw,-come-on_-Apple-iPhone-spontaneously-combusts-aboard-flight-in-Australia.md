This is just a [weird story:](<http://www.bgr.com/2011/11/28/apple-iphone-
spontaneously-combusts-aboard-flight-in-australia/>)

> "An Apple iPhone spontaneously began smoking and emitting a red glow while
> aboard an airplane in Australia. Passengers aboard Regional Express flight
> ZL319 were welcomed to their destination in Sydney, Australia on Friday by a
> frightening ordeal. According to the airline, a passenger’s iPhone began
> “emitting a significant amount of dense smoke” shortly after the flight
> landed, and the smoke was accompanied by a red glow." ( **from** [Bioy
