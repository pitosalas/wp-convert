Long time readers of this blog (yes, I can say that now, it's been 2 years or
so 🙂 know that I am a
[Dave](<http://davenet.scripting.com/2000/02/04/howToMakeMoneyOnTheInternet>)
[Winer](</weblogs/archives/000295.html>)
[fan](</weblogs/archives/000575.html>) [and](</weblogs/archives/000343.html>)
a daily reader of [Scripting News](<http://www.scripting.com/>). In
yesterday's posts, [Dave talks about life and
death](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/01#morningCoffeeNotes>), honest,
open, sincere, like no one else can: "What's it like to die? Some people
believe they know, but that's just a belief. You won't know for sure until it
happens to you. And that, my friends, is both the curse and the blessing of
humanity. It's the curse because it haunts each of us from the age of seven or
eight when it first hits us that _we 're going to die too."_ (from [Morning
Coffee Notes](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/01#morningCoffeeNotes>),
Scripting News.) I remember, but for me it happened around age 11 or 12, but
it was the same experience. **Anyway** , it's Dave's birthday today, so this
post is in his honor. As it happens Dave and I are almost the same age. For me
the big five-oh is coming in about 6 months. So Dave, **Mazel Tov** on your
birthday, and I hope to still be reading you when we both are **eighty**!
