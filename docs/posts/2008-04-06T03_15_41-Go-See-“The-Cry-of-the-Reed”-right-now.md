I just came back from the theatre, the [Huntington Theatre, Boston's,
production of a brand new play called "The Cry of the Reed"
](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?id=4012&src=t>)by
[Sinan

This play and production is truly amazing, great, dramatic, thought provoking,
and overall excellent.

We were discussing this play the whole drive home. Talking about war,
religion, morality, ethics, human nature, theatre and drama.

I like seeing these productions **before** the pundits and professional
reviewers decide if it's any good. I went there tonight not even knowing what
this play was about and happy not to have been influenced by some stupid
reviewer. This world premiere better get a **five star rating** IMHO.

Em. Yeah. **I liked it.**
