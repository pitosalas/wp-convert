Ethan Zuckerman writes a great piece about how Paul Simon's Graceland album
came to be, with some of the historical context, backstory and being a
xenophile. A great read:

> "At its best, Graceland sounds like Simon is encountering forces to large
> for him to understand or control. He’s riding on top of them, offering free-
> form reflections on a world that’s vastly more complicated and colorful than
> the narrow places he and Art Garfunkel explored in their close harmonies. In
> “Boy in the Bubble” (video above), the chorus, “These are the days of
> miracle and wonder, this is the long distance call” could serve as a tagline
> for anyone confronting our strange, connected world." (From [Ethan

By the way, while on the topic of Paul Simon, you should checkout the little
known (at least as it seems to me) Simon Album "[Songs From the
Capeman](<http://georgegraham.com/simon.html>)". It's really excellent and
worth a listen.
