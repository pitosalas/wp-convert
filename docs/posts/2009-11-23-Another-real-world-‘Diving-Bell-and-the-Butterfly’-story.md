Did you read the book ["The Diving Bell and The
Butterfly"](<http://www.amazon.com/Diving-Bell-Butterfly-Memoir-
Death/dp/0375701214>)? Or see the movie? It's quite an amazing story of a man
with so-called ["Locked-In Syndrome"](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-
in_syndrome>). It's an absolutely riveting story. Here's a [new account of a
similar
story](<http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091123/ap_on_he_me/eu_belgium_coma_recovery>)
that occurred in Brussels. From the article:

> 'A breakthrough came when he was able to indicate yes or no by slightly
> moving his foot to push a computer device placed there by Laureys' team.
> Then came the spelling of words using his finger and a touch-screen attached
> to his wheelchair.
>
> "You have to imagine yourself lying in bed wanting to speak and move but
> unable to do so — while in your head you are OK," Vanhaudenhuyse said. "It
> was extremely difficult for him and he showed a lot of anger, which is
> normal since he was very frustrated," she said.' ( **from** "[Son In Coma
> Heard Everything for 23
> Years](<http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091123/ap_on_he_me/eu_belgium_coma_recovery>)")
