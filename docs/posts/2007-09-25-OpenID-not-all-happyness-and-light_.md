I don't follow the Identify world that closely and like everyone I've now come
across services who suggest that you log into them with an [[tag]OpenId[/tag]
account](<http://openid.net/>). So I have one now too. It's free. It's
decentralized. What's not to love?

Well apparently it isn't 100% love. Read this article, by [tag]Stefan
Brands[/tag], who admittedly seems to be closely associated with a competing
service,
[[tag]Credentica[/tag]](<http://www.credentica.com/u-prove_sdk.html>), which
might well be the anti-OpenID. So he's got his own biases:

> "[snip…]OpenID was designed as a lightweight solution for “trivial” use
> cases in identity management: its primary goal is to enable Internet surfers
> to replace self-generated usernames and passwords by a single login
> credential, without needing more than their browser. Concretely,
> [OpenID](<http://openid.net/>) aims to enable individuals to post blog
> comments and log into social networking sites without having to remember
> multiple passwords. (Of course, local password store utilities already do
> that; more on this later.)[snip…]" (from [The Identify
> Corner)](<http://www.idcorner.org/?s=openid>)

Still this long article quotes many many other writers, so whatever the bias
it is shared by many. And from my "B+" level of knowledge of the broad world
of security, there's some highly valid criticisms in here. You should read the
actual article, but here's a nice laundry list to get you going:

> "[snip…]Beyond this, OpenID is pretty much useless. The reasons for this are
> many: OpenID is highly vulnerable to phishing and other attacks, creates
> insurmountable privacy problems, is not a trust system, suffers from
> usability problems, and makes it unappealing to become an OpenID “consumer.”
> Many smart people have already elaborated on these problems in various
> forums. In the rest of this post I will be quoting from and pointing to
> their critiques.[snip…]" (from [The Identify
> Corner)](<http://www.idcorner.org/?s=openid>)
