Aleksey (my colleague on BlogBridge) is planning to move from the Ukraine to
Australia. Here's a fairly fascinating account of the experience of proving
that he knows enough English to be permitted to Australia. Check out [this
post](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noizZze/~3/122697961/>) from
[noizZze](<http://blog.noizeramp.com>) to read about his interesting
adventure:

> "IELTS test is an indispensable part of the process as we have to prove our
> language abilities along with technical skills and other stuff when applying
> to the Skilled Immigration Visa. According to the requirements, I need a
> pretty high score (somewhere around 7 of 10) and Kate’s needs to be at least
> 5. One interesting fact that puzzles everyone I speak to is that if your
> spouse (non-primary applicant) fails to get above the threshold, you are to
> pay approximately USD $2000 for him/her to study the language there in AU
> upon arrival. Interesting!"
