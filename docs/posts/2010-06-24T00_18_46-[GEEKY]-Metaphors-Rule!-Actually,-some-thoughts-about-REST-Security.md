I don't know yet whether I agree with or disagree with what is said in "[REST
Security (or lack
thereof)](<http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2006/12/rest_security_o.html>)"
but you have to admit that this metaphor kills:

> "Until then, we'll just continue (asGene Spafford said) using an armored car
> to deliver between someone living in a cardboard box and someone living on a
> park bench." (from [1
> Raindrop](<http://1raindrop.typepad.com/1_raindrop/2006/12/rest_security_o.html>))
