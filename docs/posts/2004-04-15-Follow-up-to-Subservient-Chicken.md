>> The true story comes out about the most excellent subservient chicken
gimick. [I mentioned it ](</weblogs/archives/000385.html>)a few days ago when
I first saw it; it was amazing how quickly it spread. [Here is an article
](<http://www.adweek.com/aw/creative/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000486708>)giving
some background on how it was done, where it came from and what the thinking
was: "In fact, CP+B came up with about 400 different actions that the chicken
could do, and then filmed them in the course of a day in Los Angeles."
