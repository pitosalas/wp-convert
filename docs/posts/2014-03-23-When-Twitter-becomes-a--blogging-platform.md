I have been noticing more and more **serialized tweets**. In other words,
someone tweets several times in a row because what they have to say will not
fit into 140 characters. They number them and fire them off one after the
other. That way you, the reader, can reassemble them in your head. Of course
the arrive in reverese order (the newest ones are the last one.) Also you need
some way to note that your series is over, which might beget a new twitter
shorthand <EOM>

Why, if I can attach a 5 minute video or a photograph or a 3 minute mp3 to a
tweet, **can 't I attach a 2 paragraph messge?** Why not allow me to have as
much text, and why not fonts and styles? It's just a matter of time.

The 140 Character Limit was the **gimmick**  that **differentiated Twitter**
from all other messaging platforms at the time. But we in a new era now.
Twitter has established itself. Your twitter handle has become almost as
**self-identifying as your actual name** (or maybe more so, because it is
guaranteed unique, world-wide.)

It's a totally natural set up for the **ultimate, universal, blogging
platform.** I see that happening.

Someone said, Twitter is trying to become more and more like Facebook, and
Facebook more and more like twitter. And both are the worse for it. Maybe when
Twitter starts accepting long messages people will say that **Twitter jumped
the shark.** I doubt it. I think it's inevitable.
