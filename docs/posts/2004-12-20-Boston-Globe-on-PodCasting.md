The Boston[ Globe writes an insightful
article](<http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/12/20/through_ipod_technology_anyone_can_be_a_broadcaster/>)
about Podcsating (**note:** the link will turn stale tomorrow, but I will try
and update it if I can find the article elsewhere on the web.)

>>> "If Internet-based weblogs turned everyone into a potential newspaper
columnist, and digital cameras let them become photojournalists, podcasting is
promising to let everyone with a microphone and a computer become a radio
commentator."
