David Colletta shared [this link in
comments](<http://www.evanjones.ca/farewell-mit.html>) to my [recent post
about team work](</imported-20111103233638/2012/1/4/teaching-group-
projects.html>). David's link was good enough that I thought I should excerpt
it to increase the chances that my colleagues and students at Brandeis see it.

Here's an excerpt from it:

I am a passionate believer that a solid undergraduate education must include
such experiences. To belittle them as "vocational" or "you can just learn that
on the job" is short sighted and short changes everyone.

My personal knowledge is of Computer Science but the same I am sure can be
said for other disciplines as well.
