**Link: [Google+ – Professional Social Network?](None):** ""



Some people are starting to wonder whether [Google+ ](</>)will continue to
grow and become a major social network. Even for Google, it will be **quite an
achievement** to penetrate the already relatively crowded world of social
networks and become a major player.

Indeed they have had an excellent start and in my opinion built quite a nice
little service. (By the way, do not underestimate how much they must have
spent designing, building and now deploying [Google+](</>). I call it a 'nice
little service' but I know we are talking many millions of dollars.)

Here's what one pundit said as criticism in a recent article:

> "In that respect, is it possible that [G+](</>), at the moment, is simply a
> social media step too far? Are there only so many daily destination-and-
> connection sites a person can invest time and effort overseeing?

I am not sure. I use Facebook for personal and family networks, and have
relatively few business contacts on it. To date, I've used LinkedIn for my
business contacts. But LinkedIn is not a social network in the sense of
Facebook.

Maybe that will be [Google Plus'](</>) niche: the **professional social
network.**
