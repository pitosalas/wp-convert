I have IM accounts on Yahoo, AOL and MSN. Actually I use the AOL by far the
most, but I have an occasional correspondent on Yahoo and MSN. By the way, on
Mac OS X, I use the terrific client "[Adium](<http://www.adiumx.com/>)" which
talks all those protocols, and is free. It is a nice UI on to the well known
[GAIM](<http://gaim.sourceforge.net/>) (GNU AIM) open source project. **Almost
daily** I get one or two new IM pings from unknown people, or more likely,
robots, with some kind of a spam element, which I have to block to stop.  The
weird thing is, the IM Spam**is always from Yahoo** , never from AOL or MSN.
Are they doing something **different**? Technorati Tags:
