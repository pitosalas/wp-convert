>> I have IM accounts on Yahoo, AOL and MSN. Actually I use the AOL by far the
most, but I have an occasional correspondent on Yahoo and MSN. By the way, on
Mac OS X, I use the terrific client "[Adium](<http://www.adiumx.com/>)" which
talks all those protocols, and is free. It is a nice UI on to the well known
[GAIM](<http://gaim.sourceforge.net/>) (GNU AIM) open source project.

>>

>> **Almost daily** I get one or two new IM pings from unknown people, or more
likely, robots, with some kind of a spam element, which I have to block to
stop.

>>

>> The weird thing is, the IM Spam **is always from Yahoo** , never from AOL
or MSN. Are they doing something **different**?
