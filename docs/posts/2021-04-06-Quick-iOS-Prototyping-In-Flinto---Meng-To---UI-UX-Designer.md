**Link: [Quick iOS Prototyping In Flinto | Meng To - UI/UX Designer](http://blog.mengto.com/quick-ios-prototyping-flinto):** "There are many iOS prototyping tools out there: Briefs 2, POP, Prototypr just to name a few. The one that really struck me as the most efficient is Flinto by far. Ironically, it’s the only Web-based tool amongst them. And there is nothing better out there. It will literally take minutes to create a prototype that looks like it was made using Xcode Storyboard."
