>> What would you do if you received **two letters** from a collection agency
saying that you owed $5,000 to a firm with whom you've **never** had an
account with?

>> I ignored it and the following letter, immediately smelling a **rat**.

>> What would you do further, if you got a call from that agency, and you told
them that you had never heard of them, and that you had **never had an
account** with the firm?

>> I told them to go to hell.

>> And then they asked if I was willing to **just verify** some information.
Like the last 4 digits of my social security number.

>>

>> I told them, even more forcefully, to go to hell.

>>

>> And then they asked whether I would be **willing** to confirm the last 4
digits if they read them to me?

>>

>> I told them again to go away telling them I definitely smelled a rat and
thought this was some kind of **identity theft scam**.

**confirm information** that he was giving me. Four simple digits.
