Remember when the Berlin wall came down and the Soviet Union ended up breaking
up? People talked about **the power of decentralizaiton** , about how simple
faxes were used by individual Soviet citizens to tell the world what was going
on and topple the ultimate centralized power?

>>

>> Or the impact of the television coverage of the **Vietnam** war had such an
effect on the way things turned out? Or **Tiananmen Square?** Or the impact of
consumer camcorders on the impact of the Rodney King trial and subsequent
riots in L.A.?

>>

>> The shameful and shocking scandal of **prisoner abuse and torture** follows
the same pattern. Who can imagine what was going through the minds of these
people as they were committing these acts? Who, further can imagine what they
were thinking as they were taking snapshots of this?

>>

>> But see where it's leading: who would have thought that these people
wandering around with their pocket **Canon 's and Nikons** will have had a
**profound, long-term, global impact** on this country and this war. Ultimate
decentralization, again.
