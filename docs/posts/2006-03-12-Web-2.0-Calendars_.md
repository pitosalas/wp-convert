>> **I 'm not sure I get it.**

>> It **seems to me** that working **even when off-line** , even when away
from my computer, would be **top requirements** for any **calendar** product.

use GMail with Apple (Mac OS X) Mail when I am at my primary computer, and
over the web everywhere else (including my cell phone.)
