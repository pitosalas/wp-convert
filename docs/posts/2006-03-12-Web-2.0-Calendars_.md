>> **I 'm not sure I get it.**

>> It **seems to me** that working **even when off-line** , even when away
from my computer, would be **top requirements** for any **calendar** product.
In other words, a downloadable **application** (Outlook anyone? iCal?
Blackberry?)

>> I'd be **worried** if I could only access my calendar on live web
connection.

>> Sure, **GMail** is hugely popular, and you could make that same argument
there. But GMail lets me synch with any POP-client of which there are many. I
use GMail with Apple (Mac OS X) Mail when I am at my primary computer, and
over the web everywhere else (including my cell phone.)
