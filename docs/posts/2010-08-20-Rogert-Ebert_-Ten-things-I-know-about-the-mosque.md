I bet many of you didn't realize that Roger Ebert is still writing a fantastic
column, with movie reviews yes, but also some excellent written commentary.
For example, check this fine post [Ten things I know about the
mosque](<http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/08/ten_things_i_know_about_the_mo.html>)
from [Roger Ebert's Journal](<http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/atom.xml>):

> 1\. America missed a golden opportunity to showcase its Constitutional

> religion can build a church, so can all religions. (**from:**[Ten things I
> know about the
> mosque](<http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/08/ten_things_i_know_about_the_mo.html>))
