Here's a really cool idea (via [Boing Boing ](<http://www.boingboing.net/>)-
see their
[story](<http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/04/bbc_news_proxy_makes.html>)) -
Creating a web site, identical to an existing one, except that certain words
have been changed to links. A very powerful idea. [Read the [article
](<http://www.whitelabel.org/>)](<http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/04/bbc_news_proxy_makes.html>)and
[see the
site](<http://www.whitelabel.org/wp/wikiproxy.php?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3711092.stm>).

>> In [BlogBridge ](<http://www.blogbridge.com>)we already have [automatic
highlights of keywords](</weblogs/archives/000494.html>). That is, you can
specify a set of words or phrases you care about, and BlogBridge will
[highlight them ](</weblogs/archives/screen.jpg>)whenever they occur in a Blog
posting.  
> **  
> What if:** in addition to preprocessing words for highlighting we also
> **preprocessed them for magic links**. In other words, automatically certain
> words in a blog posting would be turned into links. Wow!

>> There are variations here:

>>

>>   * We could allow you to specify a URL with your keywords and then instead
of simply highlighting, magically convert the keyword into a link.

>>   * We could have a large glossary of words of interest on our BlogBridge
server and map them to links.

>>   * We could (following the example that inspired this) look up words which
occur frequently in WikiPedia and supply links to that.

>>   * We could look them up in Google (using the Google API) and supply links
to that!

>>

>> **It boggles the mind**. Food for thought.


* **Link to site:** **[Magic Links](None)**
