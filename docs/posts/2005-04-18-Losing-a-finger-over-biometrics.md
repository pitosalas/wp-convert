>>> "They stripped Mr Kumaran naked and left him by the side of the road - but
not before **cutting off the end** of his index finger with a machete. (from
the [BBC)](<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm>)"

>>

>> There, I got your **attention** , didn't I? That's from the always
fascinating monthly mailing on security, [Crypto-
Gram](<http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0504.html#2>), from Bruce Schneier.
He has a very interesting [piece](<http://www.schneier.com/crypto-
gram-0504.html#2>) on "New Risks of Biometrics", where you can see the law of
unintended consequences in full bloom:

>>

>>> "It's certainly possible to design fingerprint readers that test for
"liveness": pulse, body temperature, etc. But these new security
countermeasures will result in new criminal tactics, and the cycle will
continue."

>>

>> A similar scenario was used in the movie ["Minority
Report"](<http://www.minorityreport.com/>) which at the time might have seem
outlandish, but now, I guess not so much. By the way, here's another bit of
Minority report futurism is now creeping into reality:

>>

>>> "In the futuristic movie "Minority Report," Tom Cruise gestures with his
gloved hands to sift through crime-clue data that are displayed on giant
screens. With the twist of a wrist he can move information from one column to
another or delete items." ([from the Wall Street
Journal)](<http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs024/min_report/wall_st_jrnl.htm>)
