**Link: [Kurzweil AI.net has some good stuff](None):** ""

I knew about [this site](<http://www.kurzweilai.net/>) but recently came
across a link to another quite interesting article, "Why We Can be Confident
of Turing Test Capability Within a Quarter of a Century".  Yes, Kurzweil's
books are too long and repetitive, and he does hold some unusual views, but
the guy's a total genius and always fun to read. I don't think the article
delivers on the subtitle: "The advent of strong AI (exceeding human
intelligence) is the most important transformation this century will see, and
it will happen within 25 years, says Ray Kurzweil [â€¦]" (**from** [Why We Can
Be Confident of Turing Test Capability Within a Quarter
Century](<http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=memelist.html?m=4%23683>))
[This
article](<http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=memelist.html?m=4%23683>)
still is an excellent review of the state of the art in AI and is highly
readable. The [Kurzweil AI](<http://www.kurzweilai.net/>) site itself is also
worth keeping an eye on! Technorati Tags:
