![](https://i0.wp.com/farm1.static.flickr.com/95/209335822_ff4026fe2e.jpg?w=584)The
other day I came across this article in the Boston Globe about one of the
greats of Computer Science, Seymour Papert, inventor of the seminal Logo
programming language and many other important accomplishments.

> "He was long a jewel of the MIT faculty. Now, after a devastating brain
> injury, mathematician Seymour Papert is struggling bravely to learn again
> how to think like, speak like, be like the man of genius he was." (from [In
> Search of a Beautiful Mind, The Boston
> Globe](<http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2008/07/12/in_search_of_a_beautiful_mind/>))

Hard to believe that I hadn't heard of it before. So Sad. [Read the whole
article, it's
worthwhile.](<http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2008/07/12/in_search_of_a_beautiful_mind/>)
