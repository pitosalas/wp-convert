  * [The GVL and C Extensions - a cooperative partnership](<https://mailchi.mp/railsspeed/the-gvl-and-c-extensions-a-cooperative-partnership?e=5a26f26f7d>)

  * [Introducing nushell](<http://www.jonathanturner.org/2019/08/introducing-nushell.html>)

Yes, but, do we need another shell? Do we all have to learn Rust? What about a
