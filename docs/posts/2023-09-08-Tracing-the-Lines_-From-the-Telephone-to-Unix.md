**Link: [Tracing the Lines: From the Telephone to Unix](https://www.deusinmachina.net/p/history-of-unix?r=1slq0e&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post):** "The telephone, invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, sparked a revolution in communication. A year later, in 1877, he established the Bell Telephone Company. This marked the beginning of a fascinating journey, leading to the formation of the Volta Bureau in 1880. Guided by Bell, the Volta Bureau became a research hub, making strides in multiple scientific fields."

Great history about Unix!
