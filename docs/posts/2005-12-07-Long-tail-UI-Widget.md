This is kind of **cool**.

>> I am playing around with the [Last.FM](<http://www.last.fm/>) music
service.

>> Among the many things it does, is that It 'watches' everything you play
with iTunes to figure out your music tastes. And then with that, [Last.FM
](<http://www.last.fm/>)recommends music that you might like.

>> What caught my eye is the first use of the [famous 'long tail'
graph](<http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html>) as a User
Interface element. You can drag the vertical bar right and left to affect
whether the recommended music is more in the popular or obscure range of
possibilities. **Cute**!
