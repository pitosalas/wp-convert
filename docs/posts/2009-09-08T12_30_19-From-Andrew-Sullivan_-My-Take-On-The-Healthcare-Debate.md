I agree with this point from the post [My Take On The Healthcare
Debate](<http://www.pheedcontent.com/click.phdo?i=3427a348815a338daa7346e55a0001d7>)
from [Daily Dish (Andrew
Sullivan)](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/andrewsullivan/rApM>):

> _" If you have to strip out of a bill a mere conversation with seniors about
> powers-of-attorney for end-of-life decisions, you are not interested in a
> serious conversation about curtailing healthcare costs."_
