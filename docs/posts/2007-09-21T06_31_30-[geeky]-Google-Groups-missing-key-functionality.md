title: "[geeky] Google Groups missing key functionality"

I've been living inside a couple of [tag]Google groups[/tag] lately, posting
questions and waiting for answers. (Which ones? [Ruby on Rails:
Talk](<http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk>) and [[tag]Active
Scaffold[/tag]: Ruby on Rails
plugin](<http://groups.google.com/group/activescaffold>))

Much to my surprise and [tag]productivity-loss[/tag], it's not possible to
request an email alert when someone posts an answer to your question. Odd,
this is a oldie-but-goodie feature in many many mailing lists. So I am reduced
to checking manually every day or so. (You can see it annoyed me sufficiently
to bother writing this 🙂
