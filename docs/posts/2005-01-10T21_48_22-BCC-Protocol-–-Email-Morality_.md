What does the existence of "BCC" (which I think stands for the anachronism
"blind carbon copy") tell us about the social norms of emails? This thought
occurred to me just now as I was the recipient of an email (corresponding to
(3) in the not at all uncommon scenario that I describe below.

>> It is an interesting piece of deception that we all participate in, isn't
it? Has anyone ever thought about the morality of email addressing?

>>

>> Scenario:

>>

>>   1. X sends an email to: A, CC: B and C

>>   2. A does a "Reply all" so that B, C and X see the response

>>   3. A sends an email directly to X, BCC to B

>>

>> Analysis:

>>

>>   1. X wants to tell A, something, and make sure that B and C also hear. X
wants to communicate that the message is meant for A, that A is the one who is
expected to respond, but wants each of them to know that the others are
getting that same information.

>>   2. A wants to answer X, and make sure that B and C see the response. Why?
**Perhaps** A wants to make sure that A, B, and C keep their story straight?
**Perhaps** A actually wants to tell B or C something, uses the Reply All as a
carrier for that message, thereyby getting some cover.

>>   3. Now, this gets interesting. Apparently A wants X to think that he is
getting some information privately. But at the same time wants B to know that
X has gotten this information. Why? **Perhaps** A would like B to make the
same point to X, and make it look like the it was independent. Or **perhaps**
A wants to make sure that if X asks B about it, B says the same thing that A
said.

>>

>>

>> Hmm, sounds like a bit of interpersonal deception is going on here. I am
not casting judgement - I've played the role of X, A, B or C more than once.
But it does make you think.

>>

>> What would Dear Abby say?

>>

>> **Update:** As one wag said to me in email: "I think Dear Abby might say
that Pito needs a hobby :-)"
