I feel really bad for President Obama and I am still a big fan. But. As we all
know now, this is a total disaster, on a lot of levels. For first hand
experience, I tried to create an account on Healthcare.gov about the middle of
October. After several tries I managed to do it. Yesterday I tried to log into
the site to see how things were going, and after several tries and I managed
to log in. But I didn't get too far  before I got a 404 error.

Those of us who have worked on, or seen close up how a complex "web site" is
built have a feeling of how complicated this is. And coupled with other
factors and complications (like politics and buareaucratic ineptitude) we
can't say this is not a movie we've seen before. But that doesn't begin to
explain nor excuse it. Here's a good behind the scenes article:
