Another [great
article](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>) in The
Atlantic, James Fallows: "[Declaring
Victory](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>)"

>>

>>> "The United States is **succeeding** in its struggle against terrorism.
The time has come to **declare** the war on terror **over** , so that an even
more effective military and diplomatic campaign can begin." (James Fallows,
**from** [Declaring
Victory](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>))

>>

>> Yes it sounds **very strange** given **today 's occurrences**, but it's an
excellent article that is kind of persuasive. It doesn't go in the direction
that the blurb above might make you think.

>>

>>> "But the overall prospect looks **better** than many Americans believe,
and better than nearly all political rhetoric asserts. The essence of the
change is this: because of al-Qaeda's own mistakes, and because of the things
the United States and its allies have done right, al-Qaeda's ability to
inflict direct damage in America or on Americans has been sharply reduced. Its
successor groups in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere will continue to
pose dangers.  But its hopes for fundamentally harming the United States now
rest **less** on what it can do itself than on what it can **trick** ,
**tempt** , or **goad** us into **doing**. Its destiny is no longer in its own
hands." (James Fallows, **from** [Declaring
Victory](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>))

>>

>> May you live in interesting times.
