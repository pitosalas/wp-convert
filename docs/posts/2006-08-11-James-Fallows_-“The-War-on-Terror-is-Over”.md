>> Another [great
article](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>) in The
Atlantic, James Fallows: "[Declaring
Victory](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>)"

>>

>>> "The United States is **succeeding** in its struggle against terrorism.
The time has come to **declare** the war on terror **over** , so that an even
more effective military and diplomatic campaign can begin." (James Fallows,
**from** [Declaring
Victory](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>))

>>

>> Yes it sounds **very strange** given **today 's occurrences**, but it's an
excellent article that is kind of persuasive. It doesn't go in the direction
that the blurb above might make you think.

>>

>>> "But the overall prospect looks **better** than many Americans believe,
and better than nearly all political rhetoric asserts. The essence of the
change is this: because of al-Qaeda's own mistakes, and because of the things
the United States and its allies have done right, al-Qaeda's ability to
inflict direct damage in America or on Americans has been sharply reduced. Its
successor groups in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere will continue to
pose dangers.

>>>

>>> But its hopes for fundamentally harming the United States now rest
**less** on what it can do itself than on what it can **trick** , **tempt** ,
or **goad** us into **doing**. Its destiny is no longer in its own hands."
(James Fallows, **from** [Declaring
Victory](<http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/fallows_victory>))

>> May you live in interesting times.
