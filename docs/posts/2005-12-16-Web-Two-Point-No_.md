>> Om Malik [writes](<http://gigaom.com/2005/12/16/the-web-20-hit-by-

>>> "Over past 48 hours, there have been reports of Web 2.0 outages. Six
Apart, one of the biggest blog service provider is experiencing serious
downtime, which has left many a few influential bloggers in a tears of rage.

>> Om connects this news, correctly, to scalability. Scalability is very very
hard, and any site as popular as TypePad is certainly extraordinarily hard to
architect and run reliably, Web 2.0 or no.

Ajax, actually works to look me in the eye and honestly say this isn't just
Web 1.1. Come on." ( **from** [Darwinian web, read all of
it.](<http://darwinianweb.com/archive/2005/136.html>))
