>>> "Over past 48 hours, there have been reports of Web 2.0 outages. Six
Apart, one of the biggest blog service provider is experiencing serious
downtime, which has left many a few influential bloggers in a tears of rage.

hard, and any site as popular as TypePad is certainly extraordinarily hard to
architect and run reliably, Web 2.0 or no.

Web 1.1. Come on." ( **from** [Darwinian web, read all of
