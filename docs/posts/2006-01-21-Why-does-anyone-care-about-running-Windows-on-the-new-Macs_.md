title: "Why does anyone care about running Windows on the new Macs?"

When you're a blogger it's sometimes a **strain** to say something **new**
about a topic that's [gone around and
around](<http://www.google.com/search?q=intel%20mac%20vista%20xp>). I am
pretty sure you've seen the announcement from Apple that their [next
generation of Macintosh computers will use Intel
processors](<http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/>). Other than the industry
**melodrama** about Steve Jobs embracing the very chips that for years he
insulted, and perhaps bemusement of how Steve got that Intel Exec to dress up
in a silly white costume while Steve looked cool in his traditional black
turtle-neck. But other than that, who cares that Mac's are now going to have
"Intel Inside"? I mean for me it's kind of like finding out that next year's
model car is switching to a Bosch electronic ignition from a GM model. There's
also [been a lot of commentary](<http://engadget.com/2006/01/11/no-xp-on-
intel-macs-but-vista-is-good-to-go/>) on
[whether](<http://www.betanews.com/article/XP_Wont_Run_on_Intel_MacBook_iMac/1137003330>)
the new Intel based Macs would run Microsoft Windows. One the one hand it's
again a bit [gossipy](<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10794396/from/RS.3/>):
"Would Apple bury the hatchet with Microsoft or would they spitefully prohibit
(legally) or prevent (technically) this?" There's a more interesting
_strategic_ question there though.  It relates to how Apple for years and
years kept their software and hardware **proprietary**. Nobody but Apple could
make Macs and no computers but Macs could run the Mac OS.  This new
development opens the door a **crack** , and if Windows could run on the new
Macs, it would open even further. The next natural question would be, could
Mac's OS X Operating System run on a Dell? Would Apple **permit** it? **How
about this one** : It is conceivable to me that Windows Vista would run
**better** on Apple hardware than any other. Now wouldn't that be a **hoot**?
How could that happen? Better in the sense of more reliably and robustly. Not
because Apple designs better hardware than Dell (although they might.)  It
could happen because Apple hardware **is a lot more closed** than PC
compatible computers. The configurations that occur in the field are far
**more limited** and well known. No old **Acme Brand** network cards or
motherboards out there.  Hence Microsoft (and Apple) potentially will be able
to deliver **a more solid solution when combining WIndows Vista with Intel
based Macs.** _If Steve allows it._ Technorati Tags:
