I [wrote the other day about the 'amusing' dust-up between](</2009/10/30/oh-
snap-detailed-take-down-of-steve-levitt-of-superfreakonimics/>) the
[RealClimate blog](<http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/an-
open-letter-to-steve-levitt/>) and Levitt and Dubner, authors of [Super
Freakonomics](<http://superfreakonomicsbook.com/>).

Well today I see in the [Wall Street
Journal](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704335904574495643459234318.html?mod=rss_most_emailed_week>),
a defense of Levitt and Dubner, but it's an odd one. It actually supplies no
facts (unlike the article I sited) just a criticism of 'pro-climate-change'
(forgive the generalization) people [not being open to new
ideas](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704335904574495643459234318.html?mod=rss_most_emailed_week>):

Other than being amused by the tone of "[An Open Letter To Steve
Levitt](<http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/an-open-letter-
to-steve-levitt/>)", the [original cat fight paper that I
cited](</2009/10/30/oh-snap-detailed-take-down-of-steve-levitt-of-
superfreakonimics/>) (note that if Steven Levitt was a woman I would probably
be accused of sexism by calling it a cat fight) in my previous post, that
article itself had a bit of fishyness to me.

My eyes rolled a little when the RealClimate article used a google search for
'[world electricity
consumption](<http://www.google.com/search?q=world+electricity+consumption&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-
US:official&client=firefox-a>)' as the starting point of a highly quantitative
argument (Google's answer, via www.cia.gov, is 16.83 Trillion KWh / year, in
2005). [Wolfram Alpha says it's 15.45 Trillion KWh, in
2007](<http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=world+electricity+consumption>))
Pretty close, so probably that's ok.
