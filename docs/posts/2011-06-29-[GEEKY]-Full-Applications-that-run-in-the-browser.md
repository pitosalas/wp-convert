[Sproutcore](<http://www.sproutcore.com/about/>) is a JavaScript framework for
writing powerful web applications with less code. It looks to me as a way to
write a lot more of your application in JavaScript running in the browser. And
this involves moving the logic of the application's own logic there.

[Sproutcore](<http://www.sproutcore.com/about/>) is a big complicated system
that I have not fully investigated. It comes with a good pedigree though and
is very nicely documented and designed. Worth a look if you want to have a
super responsive browser based app that will continue to work even when the
network connection is gone.

> Here is their own blurb: "SproutCore applications move business logic to the
> browser so they can respond to your users' taps and clicks immediately,
> avoiding an agonizing roundtrip across often intermittent network
> connections.
>
> As web application users go increasingly mobile, applications can no longer
> depend on reliable connections to a remote server to do the heavy lifting.
>
> At the same time, web browsers continue to radically improve their ability
> to quickly process data and deliver polished user interfacesâ€”a perfect
> opportunity to rethink the architecture of modern web applications."
