I really like this approach to vacation. I think I will try it: Check out this
post [Warning: Email Sabbatical is Imminent .. and other random
thoughts](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/zephoria/thoughts/~3/476456764/warning_email_s.html>):

> "For those who are unaware of my approach to vacation… I believe that email
