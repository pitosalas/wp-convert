>> All software has bugs, no doubt. So pulling out one story to make a point
isn't really fair. (Especially recalling the story about **stones** and
**glass houses**.)

>>

>> But if I looked I know I could find **story after story** , including some
that I could write from first hand experience, about the **terrible rough
edges** on all the software on which our much beloved blogosphere runs. And
from that observation and those stories comes the premise of this post. Here's
one of the stories:

>>

>>> "It all started two weeks ago when I undertook the **" drop-in"** upgrade
from Movable Type 3.14 to 3.17. Well, "drop-in" is not really the word. I had
made some changes to my server configuration that I thought should not affect
Movable Type and, in fact, did not for version 3.14.

>>>

>>> However, because of a **change in an open** source library component that
is a dependency for Movable Type 3.17, my configuration **broke** Movable Type
3.17. As a result, Movable Type was not properly **pinging** the technorati
**server** to put my tagged links in their tag repositories. There were
**other smaller** and larger issues that I independently tracked to this same
dependency." ( **from** "The [Community Engine
Blog](<http://thecommunityengine.com/home/archives/2005/06/distributed_tag.html>),
Distributed Tagging Hell", **emphases added**.)

>>

>> From my observation of this and many other stories, there is **no blog
server or service** out there that I would call **_commercial grade_**. I
don't see evidence that the current incumbents are going to deliver what is
required.

>>

>> Here are some of the requirements for that, as I see them:

>>

>>   * Installs reliably on any supported server. Doesn't require
administrator to be a technical wizard. Once installed, stays installed.

>>

>>   * Measures up to enterprise requirements in scalability and security.

>>

>>   * Integrates with other enterprise infrastructure, particularly
databases, web servers, directories, access control and enablement.

>>

>>   * Is self evident to the end users, requiring minimal IT support during
initial deployment and longer term adoption.

>>

>>

>>

>> My **bet** is that with the growing prominence and publicity around
blogging, around now is a good time to start a business to build just that.

>>

>> And let's **not get clever** about this… It's got to be **recognizably** a
blog server, not some **crazy adaptation** of an existing product that gets
the word "blog" **slapped** onto it. And on the other hand, not some **wild
hybrid** of blog, wiki, and knowledge management. Just a really **great,
industrial strength, blogging system**.

>>

>> I am **convinced** that such a beast would make money and that the time is
finally ripe for it.

>>

>> What is much less clear is whether it is sufficient to start a business.
You know what they say: "Is it a business or just a product?" … "Is it a
product or just a feature?"

>>

>> I think I will write more about this.
