If you know or remember the great Inner Beauty hot sauce, then you will be
interested in this article whice (claims to) reveal the actual, [original
recipe for Inner Beauty
Hotsauce](<http://www.seriouseats.com/required_eating/2007/02/chris-
schlesinger-gets-saucy.html>).

Let me warn you, it is very hot. I tried making a batch. It's quite easy in
the food processor. How did it come out? **I would give it a B+ on my first
attempt.** It resembles the real thing but I thought the spicyness hid the
flavor a little, and also it was a bit too watery.

Next time I will try to up the mustard quantity a little.

Still quite good, worth a try!
