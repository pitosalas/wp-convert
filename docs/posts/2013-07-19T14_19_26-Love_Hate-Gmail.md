I've been using Gmail like forever now and have converted many friends and
family members to using it. It's great and it's ridiculously cheap. Coupled
with a good ad-suppressor plug-in for Safari (Mac) it works well for me. I do
access it, almost always, via the desktop Mail app on Mac OSX, so I don't
experience it's UI all the time.

But the Gmail UI is quite bizarre, with multiple different ways to do similar
things, weird drop down menus and weird functionality in places. So it's a
little annoying, but, it does scale, it is cheap, and it is up almost all the
time.

I only briefly considered the idea of moving from Gmail to something else when
reading this article, but within seconds knew I would stay with Gmail. So all
I got out of reading the article is an idea for a lousy blog post 🙂
