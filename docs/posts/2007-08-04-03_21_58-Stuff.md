![Stuff from Dan
Perjovsch](https://i0.wp.com/s3.media.squarespace.com/production/1075723/12829350/wp-
content/uploads/2007/08/picture-2.png?w=584) I like this snippet of the art
work from a new [exhibit at the Moma of the art of Dan
Perjovsch](<http://moma.org/exhibitions/exhibitions.php?id=3956>). Ah, but is
it art? Who knows.

From [The Museum of Modern Art's web
site](<http://moma.org/exhibitions/exhibitions.php?id=3956>): "[因For his
first solo museum exhibition in the United States, the artist will draw witty
and incisive political images, in response to current events[因"

How does this relate to [Paul Graham's recent bit about
Stuff](<http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html>), and entitled "Stuff" where he
says: "[因And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it.
Throw away a perfectly good rotary telephone? I might need that one day.[因"

Not me. **I love throwing out stuff**. In fact I have a policy (that I
sometimes follow) that I should give away, sell or discard one item of stuff
before bringing in a new item of stuff into my life.
