**Link: [Virtual Assistant advice](None):** ""

I have a regular need for a small project to be done, a little bit of
research, some following up on projects and so on. I've thought about using a
"Virtual Assistant" for this but there is now so much noise in the area that
it's hard to navigate. An example of many many is
[Zirtual.com](<http://zirtual.com/how-it-works/>)

My needs are definitely episodic, so I don't want someone that I pay a fixed
monthly amount to unless it's pretty small, knowing that it can go up and down
depending on the work.

Any feedback on your experiences or thoughts about this would be really
interesting!
