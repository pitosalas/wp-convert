I continue to be fascinated by this. Is WikiLeaks a good guy or a bad guy? I
don't know how I feel yet, so I continue to read. Here are more articles that
have impressed me:

From Jeremy Wagstaff's [Loose Wire Blog](<http://www.loosewireblog.com>):

> "Asked why he chose to work with three major news outlets to release the
> Afghan data, he said it was the only way to get heard. He pointed out that
> he’d put out masses of interesting leaks on spending on the Afghan war
> previously and hardly a single journalist had picked it up.
>
> Hence the — inspired — notion of creating a bit of noise around the material
> this time around. After all, any journalist can tell you the value of the
> material is less intrinsic than extrinsic: Who else is looking for it, who
> else has got it, and if so can we publish it before them." (from [Loose Wire
> Blog](<http://www.loosewireblog.com/2010/08/a-pale-white-man-shows-us-what-
> journalism-is.html>))
