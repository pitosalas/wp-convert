We saw the ["Jersey Boys"](<http://www.jerseyboysinfo.com/>) musical in
Chicago last night. It's a lot of fun, even though the sound system at the
["Bank of America Theatre"](<http://www.lasalle-bank-theater.com/>) wasn't up
to par. Actually it was pretty awful.

The music is great and the story is interesting. Who knew that [Joe
Pesci](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pesci>) had some connection with the
[Four Seasons?](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_%28band%29>)

It makes we want to find a good memoir from one of the [Four
Seasons](<http://www.history-of-rock.com/four_seasons.htm>) describing what it
was like. Can you recommend one?
