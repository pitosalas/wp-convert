Maybe this is one [more of the futile
petitions](<http://www.pgpf.org/getinvolved/letter-to-candidates/>) that we
send around and to each other, but the goal rings true to me:

> "It is critical that our policymakers turn their attention to our  
> deteriorating financial health which, if not addressed responsibly and  
> quickly, will cause severe economic hardship for our nation and its  
> citizens, especially the young and future generations." (from "Letter to
> Candidates")

Read the [whole thing here](<http://www.pgpf.org/getinvolved/letter-to-
candidates/>), and if you like, [sign
it!](<http://www.pgpf.org/getinvolved/letter-to-candidates/#sign>)
