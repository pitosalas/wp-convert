An insightful article about higher education in the USA: [The Disadvantages of
an Elite Education](<http://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-
an-elite-education/print/>). Here are some interesting quotes. It's a long
article and all of it was quite interesting.

> "Students at places like Cleveland State also don’t get A-’s just for doing
> the work. There’s been a lot of handwringing lately over grade inflation,
> and it is a scandal, but the most scandalous thing about it is how uneven
> it’s been.
>
> Forty years ago, the average GPA at both public and private universities was
> about 2.6, still close to the traditional B-/C+ curve. Since then, it’s gone
> up everywhere, but not by anything like the same amount.
>
> The average gpa at public universities is now about 3.0, a B; at private
> universities it’s about 3.3, just short of a B+. And at most Ivy League
> schools, it’s closer to 3.4. But there are always students who don’t do the
> work, or who are taking a class far outside their field (for fun or to
> fulfill a requirement), or who aren’t up to standard to begin with
> (athletes, legacies).
>
> At a school like Yale, students who come to class and work hard expect
> nothing less than an A-. And most of the time, they get it." ( **from** T[he
> Disadvantages of an Elite Educatio](<http://www.theamericanscholar.org/the-
> disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/print/>)n)

also:

> "The political implications don’t stop there. An elite education not only
> ushers you into the upper classes; it trains you for the life you will lead
> once you get there. I didn’t understand this until I began comparing my
> experience, and even more, my students’ experience, with the experience of a
> friend of mine who went to Cleveland State.
>
> There are due dates and attendance requirements at places like Yale, but no
> one takes them very seriously. Extensions are available for the asking;
> threats to deduct credit for missed classes are rarely, if ever, carried
> out. In other words, students at places like Yale get an endless string of
> second chances.
>
> Not so at places like Cleveland State. My friend once got a D in a class in
> which she’d been running an A because she was coming off a waitressing shift
> and had to hand in her term paper an hour late." ( **from** T[he
