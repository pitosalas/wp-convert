One other product in the ' **everything old is new again** ' category is
[Quantrix](<http://www.quantrix.com/>), who say:

Unlike RulesBase, which so far is only available on Windows,
[Quantrix](<http://www.quantrix.com/>) works on Windows and Mac (and
Linux).More fun and interesting for me, Quantrix is based on a fairly faithful
knock-off of Lotus Improv, with improvemetns and additions. **Very cool!**
