In the past few years we have seen the meteoric appearance of dozens of models of the Transformer family, all of which have funny, but not self-explanatory, names.

In other words, I needed a Transformers cheat-sheet and couldn’t find a good enough one online, so I thought I’d write my own. I hope it can be useful to you too")
