This was a fun read with lots of cool insights. If your blood pressure surges
and adrenalin courses through your veins as you approach the big white
electronic temple then read on. Here's an excerpt from: [Retail Therapy:
Inside the Apple Store](<http://gizmodo.com/retail-therapy-inside-the-apple-
store-1355171329>):

> Let's explore Loss Prevention. Theft hurts profit. Theft matters more with
> portable items of great value, like say a laptop, or a smartphone, or high-
> end speakers. Multiply that value by how many different models and spare
> parts an Apple store needs to keep in stock, and you have a few million
> dollars of goods on hand. Scale up more if it's a big flagship store. That
> warrants not only video cameras and bag searches of employees, but armed
> professionals. Apple stores have the equivalent of undercover Federal Air
> Marshals on hand, like my friend Brock.
