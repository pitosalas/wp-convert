I was a **volunteer** for the Democratic Committee in Arlington Mass. They
have an **impressive** operation, just like what you've heard. For example,
the systems they used to deploy us volunteers.

I walked in the campaign office, **untrained** and **unschooled**. Within
minutes I was **assigned my very own 'turf'.** What is a turf? A turf is a
neighborhood of about two to four streets assigned to me and only me.

I was handed a clipboard with a sheaf of sheets describing my turf. The
clipboard included:

  * A map of a nearby neighborhood, with a series of dots on certain, but **not all houses**
  * A list of addresses in street order, first one side and then the other
  * With each address a list of names of people, and an area for notes
  * And a short script explaining what I was expected to do once I knocked on the door

**Note** that not all houses on the streets are marked. Only those that that
their database said were kind of on the fence and with a little nudge might
decide to go and vote for Obama and Warren. Supposedly, no definite
Republicans nor committed Democrats were on the list. The list had about 50
houses, probably they had figured out that that was the approximate tolerance
of a volunteer.

I could tell you similarly **impressive** stories about their dial-a-voter
tool that would allow me to make one or 100 calls from my home computer,
specifically targeted at undecided voters or those who might forget to vote,
tell me who they were, what to tell them, remind them where to vote and so on.
**All from** a web browser.

Very cool.

Now, in contrast. Here's an article about how Romney's system was developed
(Microsoft,) deployed (centralized in Boston) and basically crashed on
election day. Here's a nice quote:
