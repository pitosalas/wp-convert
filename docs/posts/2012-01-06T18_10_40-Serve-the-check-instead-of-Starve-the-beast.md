Here's an interesting article "[Modernizing
Conservatism"](<http://breakthroughjournal.org/content/issues/issue-2/modernizing-
conservatism.shtml>), yes, not my typical subject matter. Written from a
Conservative's viewpoint it critiques some of the pillars of American
Conservatism that might not be effective or useful anymore.

The part I found the **most interesting** is the argument against the popular
**Starve The Beast** concept in our current political discourse. As I
understand it (a big caveat) the Starve The Beast idea is that the only way to
shrink the size of government is by cutting budgets severely. Because, while
everyone agrees that government is too big (!) congress does not have the will
to shrink it by eliminating parts of it.

So instead, do it indirectly, so that the cause and effect are separated
enough and it will get through. You cut budgets in a macro way today, meaning,
**budget caps, tax cuts** , and so on -- don't go into too much detail about
the specific stuff you are cutting. And then, tomorrow, the impact of the cuts
are noticed but it's too late because the dies are cast and the **beast
shrinks or dies.**

The **problem** with this is that we (the people and the leadership) **like
the benefits of big government** so much that we revert to **deficit
spending** despite the macro cuts. See for example the **unfunded Iraq war**
that was explicitly kept ' **off the books** '. And so the beast doesn't
starve, the bill is just passed on to future generations.

The **Serve The Check** concept says, make sure that everything the government
does shows up on our tax bills. I think this implies actually raising taxes.
Maybe break them out into bits that can be identified: this line goes to the
**military** , this line goes to **health care** and so on. Now we can see in
**painful detail** on our tax returns what our taxes will be and we, the
electorate, will **insist on shrinking government.**
