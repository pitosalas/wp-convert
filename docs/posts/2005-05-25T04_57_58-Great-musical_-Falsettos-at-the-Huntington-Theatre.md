Just came back from seeing
'[Falsettos](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/production.aspx?ID=34&src=t>)',
an unusual (and unusually good) musical, at the Huntington Theatre, in Boston.
The themes cover the gamut from family, children, love, judaism,
homosexuality, life and death. The music is unusual and complex and very nice.
I recommend it highly. So much that I also just got the music from iTunes!
