Flying back home yesterday I read this article about Wikipedia in the New York
Times: [Wikipedia, What Does Judith Newman Have to Do to Get a Page? -
NYTimes.com](<http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/fashion/Wikipedia-Judith-
Newman.html>):

> The three tenets of Wikipedia articles are "No Original Research," "Neutral
> Point of View" and "Verifiability" -- terms that, in and of themselves, are
> open to debate. At any rate, Mr. Wales wanted to make real the words of
> Charles Van Doren, one of the editors of the Encylopedia Brittanica, who
> wrote in an essay in 1962: "Because the world is radically new, the ideal
> encyclopedia should be radical, too. It should stop being safe -- in
> politics, in philosophy, in science." (He was also at the center of the

It seems that there have been a number of good articles about Wikipedia
recently which prompted me to write this. For example a few months ago, again
in the NYT, magazine there was [Jimmy Wales is not an internet
billionaire."](<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/magazine/jimmy-wales-is-not-
an-internet-billionaire.html?pagewanted=all>)

Anyway the present article is interesting to me because I had not previously
seen the 'tenets' spelled out that way:

  1. Neutral POV
  2. No Original Research
  3. Verifiability

 In fact the only one I was aware of was "Neutral POV".

I hesitate to mention this (and why will be clear in a second) but there are
three wikipedia articles that mention me: [Pito
Salas](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pito_Salas>), [Lotus Improv
](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Improv>)and [Pivot
Table](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table>).

Let's be honest, being mentioned in Wikipedia at all is an honor and good for
my personal brand/reputation. I don't want to mess with that. Because of that
I don't know who wrote them and haven't really paid attention to them over the
years. And as I write that sentence, I think to myself, "Wait. I vaguely
remember fixing a typo or a date in one of them years and years ago; is it
safe to make a claim that I didn't touch them? Will I be punished? So I remove
the statement that I never touched them."

And I now look at the articles and notice that the Pito Salas article has
gotten shorter, and the other two have some inaccuracies that I know for sure
because they involve my own first hand experience. But still I hesitate to
correct them.

That's why the New York Times article I started with speaks to me. I don't
really understand or try to predict how the wikipedia community judges
entreies. I am proud to be mentioned even with minor inaccuracies. I think if
I try to correct the inaccuracies I might call attention to the entries and
lose them altogether. Even writing this post feels a little bit risky…
