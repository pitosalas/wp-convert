> consultant, how can you deliver what your customers really want? I have been
> on both sides of this relationship and experienced both successful and
> unsuccessful results. In this post, I will go through the typical aspects of
> these types of relationships and identify action items that I have used to
> forge effective and lasting customer consultant relationships for both
> parties." (from "[Effective Customer Consultant
