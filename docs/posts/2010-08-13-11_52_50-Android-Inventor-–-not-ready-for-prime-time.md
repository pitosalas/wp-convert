The other day I wrote a post where I [mentioned Google's App
Inventor](</2010/08/05/david-weinberger-has-flat-feet-programming/>), and I
mentioned it with some skepticism.

Today, a column in the [New York Times that covers Google's App
Inventor](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12pogue.html>)
in more detail, and comes to more or less the same conclusion:

> "I’m happy for App Inventor. I wish it a long and exciting life. Surely it
> will have one in schools and computer classes, among other niches.
>
> But for nonprogrammers on their own? Forget it. Android Hype Inventor is
> more like it." ( **from** [the New York
> Times](<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12pogue.html>))
