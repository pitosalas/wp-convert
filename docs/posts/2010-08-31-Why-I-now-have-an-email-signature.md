**Link: [Why I now have an email signature](None):** ""



We've been on an **SEO** binge over the last 4-6 weeks. I've been educating
myself by listening and reading to everything I can find my hands on.

What's SEO anyway? It stands for "Search Engine Optimization" and it refers to
the **science and art of getting your site to come up when people are
searching** with Google or one of the other search engines.

As I tell the story to many people, I summarize what I've learned by noting
that it's all more or less common sense, once you hear it. But for some reason
common sense isn't always so common. The source that I have learned the most
from (and where I've learned to really appreciate educational podcasts is the
["Beginning SEO podcast" from Neo1Seo.com.](<http://podcast.neo1seo.com/>)

To illustrate common sense, here is how you can put a subtler and deeper
interpretation to the above sentence.

### LEVELS of SEO ENLIGHTENMENT.

SEO is the science and art of…

  1. _… getting your **site** to come up when people are **searching** …_

  2. _… getting your site to come up when people **who have never heard of your** site are searching…_

  3. _… getting your site to come up when people who have never heard of your site are searching and **getting them to look** at it…_

  4. _…_ _getting your site to come up when people who have never heard of your site are searching, not any time but specifically when they are in **a mindset to act** , and getting them to look…_

  5. _…_ _getting your site to come up when people who have never heard of your site are searching and in a mindset to act, and getting them to look, and then actually **place an order** , sign up, or whatever it is you want them to do…_

If you bother to actually read those repetitive sentences, each one is a
logical and common sense step beyond the preceding one, but many people -
including me, pre-enlightenment, never get beyond level one. There's a whole
lot more to it than that of course but even that little bit may be a profound
insight for someone who never gave it any thought.

So what about that **email signature**? Well one of the episodes of my
favorite podcast talks about the other things you can do to help people to
actually come to your site, in a mindset to act, and then doing whatever you
want them to do.

And this one is so **common sense** and yet for years now I have not done it.

Starting today, everyone who I correspond to in email will have this friendly
little signature line at the end of it:
