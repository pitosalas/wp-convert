being conducted by [BlogOn](<http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2005/>), where I
am on the [advisory
board](<http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2005/2005/07/pito_salas.html>), about
the state of enterprise blogging. If you have a couple of minutes, you can
participate and be in the running for an iPod nano, and who doesn't want one
of those?
