survey](<http://www.surveymonkey.com/Users/70157786/Surveys/665601347079/3BE2D80C-38A7-456E-B6B9-08AA25F1744B.asp?U=665601347079&DO_NOT_COPY_THIS_LINK>)
being conducted by [BlogOn](<http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2005/>), where I
am on the [advisory
board](<http://www.blogonevent.com/blogon2005/2005/07/pito_salas.html>), about
the state of enterprise blogging. If you have a couple of minutes, you can
participate and be in the running for an iPod nano, and who doesn't want one
of those?
