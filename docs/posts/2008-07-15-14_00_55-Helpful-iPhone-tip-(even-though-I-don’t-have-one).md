I saw this somewhere and I thought I would share as it seems very useful, yet
obscure:

> **Helpful Tip:** To quickly reset your iPhone without wiping anything off it
> or retethering it to iTunes, hold the volume up button, the home button, and
> the lock button at the same time. Keep holding it even after the "Slide to
> Power Off" appears, eventually it will flash totally off and then you'll get
> the Apple logo. Let go then.
