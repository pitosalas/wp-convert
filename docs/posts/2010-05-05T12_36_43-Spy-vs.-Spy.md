Here's a [great article by Malcolm Gladwell in The New Yorker about
espionage](<http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2010/05/10/100510crat_atlarge_gladwell>).
Most of the content comes from a couple of books that he essentially is
summarizing, but in his inimical style make more fun and fascinating:

> He tells the U.S. Ambassador that the Soviets have broken the Americans’
> secret code. “We know they know our code,” the Ambassador, Moulsworth,
> replies, beaming. “We only give them things we want them to know.” The
> general pauses, during which, the play’s stage directions say, “he tries to
> make head or tail of this intelligence.” Then he crosses the street to the
> Russian Embassy, where he tells the Soviet Ambassador, Romanoff, “They know
> you know their code.” Romanoff is unfazed: “We have known for some time that
> they knew we knew their code. We have acted accordingly—by pretending to be
> duped.” The general returns to the American Embassy and confronts
> Moulsworth: “They know you know they know you know.” Moulsworth (genuinely
> alarmed): “What? Are you sure?” ( **from:** [The New
