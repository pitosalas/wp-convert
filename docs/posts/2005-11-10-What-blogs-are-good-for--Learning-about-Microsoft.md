So can you learn anything useful from a blog? I've often **spoken admiringly**
to friends [about Microsoft blogging](<http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/>).
I've said that, it's not so much that people are giving away any trade
secrets. You learn stuff that are not secret, but you probably would only find
out if you ran into someone in a Starbucks in Redmond. Exhibit #1 (which I've
used before, but continues to impress) [Steve Sinofsky's Microsoft
TechTalk](<http://blogs.msdn.com/techtalk/default.aspx>) Blog. Look at an
amazing recent post on a topic of vital interest if you are doing business or
doing partnering with MSFT.

"software release". This post will talk about our strategy around product
releases for Office products, since we have been pretty consistent over the
years and this represents a balance between some competing interests."
