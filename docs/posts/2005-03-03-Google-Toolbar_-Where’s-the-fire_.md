In case you've come across the flaming debate about how the Google Toolbar is
evil, you will [appreciate this post:](<http://www.kottke.org/05/03/google-
toolbar-autolink>)

>>

>>> "I'm a bit wary about throwing myself in the middle of the whole Google
Toolbar AutoLink business (Dan Gillmor has a good summary and lots of
trackbacks to opinions, pro and con), but I'm sort of dumbfounded that so many
people are so vehemently against it"

>>

>> That's from Kottke.org, but it could just as easily be me speaking. My
sentiments exactly. [Read Kottke's post.](<http://www.kottke.org/05/03/google-
toolbar-autolink>) One more teapot tempest
[AFAIC](<http://www.answers.com/topic/afaic>) **Correction:** While I still
agree with most of what [Kottke](<http://www.kottke.org>) said, there's one
factual error. When I played with the toolbar it automatically changed a web
page to turn addresses into links to Google Maps.
