very brief visit to Madrid (4 days) and came back enamored of the city. Madrid
is beautiful and vibrant, always busy with people that seem to be having
constant good time. People seem to be eating constantly and yet no one is fat
🙂 And the weather is fine!

It seems (see [AP

that I didn't experience everything that was going on this weekend though 🙂
