Just came across this handy-dandy tool to run tests for Ruby and Rails, and
produce much nicer and readable traces so you have a prayer to sort out what
is going on when stuff fails.

[Test::Unit Reporter -- A new look and feel for Test::Unit
output](<https://github.com/TwP/turn?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+railsquicktips+%28Rails+Quick+Tips%29>)

> TURN is a new way to view Test::Unit results. With longer running tests, it
> can be very frustrating to see a failure (….F…) and then have to wait till
> all the tests finish before you can see what the exact failure was. TURN
> displays each test on a separate line with failures being displayed
> immediately instead of at the end of the tests.
