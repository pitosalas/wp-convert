A really interesting experiment reported in various places trigger the
sensation of an [tag]out of body experience[/tag]. I read about it first in
the New York Times: ["Scientists induce Out-of-Body
Sensation."](<http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/science/23cnd-
body.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>)

But here are some additional links about it:
