# [Social Networks: Good or Bad?](None)




I've been doing quite a bit of reading about social networks in preparation
for the 2012 edition of my Brandeis University Course, "[Web and Social
Applications](<https://sites.google.com/site/jbs2012cosiwebsocial/>)". This
morning I was preparing lecture notes for "Current Issues In Social Networks".
Here are some good current links I have been able to find:

  * [Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?](<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/8930/>)
  * [Social Media's Small Positive Role in Human Relationships](<http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-medias-small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/>)
  * [Diane Rehm's Program about Social Media and Loneliness](<http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-05-14/social-media-and-loneliness>)
  * [The Flight from Conversation](<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?pagewanted=all>)

I have just come from a family reunion where there were people pulling out
iPhones at 'inappropriate times' and other people debating what has happened
to the art of conversation now that we are all Facebooking all the time.
(Guilty as charged!)

So between the two I have spent some time thinking about this phenomenon and
whether social networks and mobile phones together are a **new kind of
addictive behavior** which is doing real damage to social interactions (that
is, human to human, face to face.)

Or on the other hand, are they just an **evolution of interaction** and
communication and anyone who doesn't see it as an equally valid way of
interacting must be a fuddy duddy. Good question! And I don't really know the
answer, not even what I myself think about it.

But this article by [Zaynep
Tufekci](<http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-medias-
small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/>) contains what for me is a
**profound insight or claim:**

> "Finally, I've previously argued that some people may be "cyberasocial,"
> that is, they are unable or unwilling to invoke a sense of social presence
> through mediated communication, somewhat similar to the way we invoke
> language -- a fundamentally oral form -- through reading, which is a hack in
> our brain. I suspect such people may well be at a major disadvantage similar
> to the way people who could not or would not talk on the telephone would be
> in late 20th century." ( **from** [Social Media's Small Positive Role in
> Human
> Relationships](<http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-
> medias-small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/>))

In other words, I can imagine that when writing was 'invented' and more
importantly I suppose, when writing was becoming accessible to everyone, that
there were those who were bemoaning the loss of story telling and oral
history.

I can imagine that when the telephone started becoming popular (as indicated
in the quote above) there were those bemoaning that we no longer had to visit
together by the fireplace but could just make a phone call.

I myself can remember people who refused to have an answering machine because
they wanted to talk, or refused to leave a message because it was too
impersonal.

But none of those foretold the end of civilization. They were **evolutions**
which enriched and eventually became a commonplace aspect of the way we
interact.

**I think that 's a great insight: t**hat being in community or sharing
relationships through social media - to our Facebook friends or mailing lists
or twitter or even sharing photos in Instagram may seem to be taking time away
from our spending 'quality time' together.

But perhaps it's just the next evolution of sharing and relationships - not to
displace what came before but adding a new dimension and a new valuable
dimension to inter-personal relationships.
