Because of a couple of projects that I am working on, I thought I might be
able to use some tool for an online survey. I have two particular
requirements:

  1. respondents can be anonymous
  2. respondents are allowed to complete the survey in multiple sittings. In other words, they can go back to a form and continue where they left off.

I thought others might be trying to do the same thing so it would be nice to
share my personal (non scientific) findings:

  * The three that seemed to come up in my web search are: [Wufoo](<http://wufoo.com/>), [SurveyMonkey](<http://www.surveymonkey.com>) and [Zoomerang](<http://www.zoomerang.com/>).
  * All three have a free option that allows a basic survey to be done and some basic reports to be produced
  * [Wufoo](<http://wufoo.com/>) is very pretty and fast. Sophisticated and easy to use interface. Elegant. My only problem was that my second requirement is not supported.
  * [Zoomerang](<http://www.zoomerang.com/>) is a bit slow and did not support my second requirement either
  * [SurveyMonkey](<http://www.surveymonkey.com>) was fast and flexible but not nearly as pretty and elegant and easy to use as WuFoo.
  * In fact, of the three, only [SurveyMonkey](<http://www.surveymonkey.com>) has an option that would allow a respondent to come back and continue where they left off (my requirement)

For me, [SurveyMonkey](<http://www.surveymonkey.com>) is the right choice.
