Pretty cool report via Boston Globe, but see my minor complaint about it at
the end:

"Hold all that gloom and doom about Massachusetts as a state with little to
offer young folks. According to [Forbes.com](<http://forbes.com/>), the
second-best place in the country for young college grads is none other than
Cambridge, or more specifically the Cambridge-Newton-Framingham area, which
ranks behind only San Jose among metro areas with over 1 million people."
(**from** [Boston
Globe](<http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2009/08/07/cambridge_the_land_of_tech_and_honey/>))

It's actually quite interesting to see the underlying detail of how the study
was conducted, what was considered and not considered. You can find the detail
in the actual [Forbes Article, "Best Places to Start a
Carreer"](<http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/16/jobs-cities-career-lifestyle-real-
estate-young-professionals.html>) You learn there foreever, that 10 year
carreer results were considered, and that Harvard Students who were born in
Cambridge, and other similar biases were not considered (under the theory that
the top-10 list wanted to focus on non-native residents of the cities.)

Hey **Boston Globe Editor** : Why do you make it so **HARD** to find the
Forbes article that you're quoting? The link you provide is to the overall
Forbes site, not the actul article, which is actually not easy to find!
