With what's [going on in Iran right
now](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/world/middleeast/16iran.html?partner=rss&emc=rss>),
many commentators are wondering whether the elections were fair. That is to
say, do the reported results correspond to reality, to how people actually
voted?

I don't know of course, but I want to make a case that the notion of 'the true
result' is a difficult one, in an of itself. This of course has applicability
here as well, where we have elections being questioned in various parts of
country. Presumably we would like to know who 'really' won in Minnesota and so
on.

Here's a **thought experiment**.

Let's assume that you can, with 100% confidence, collect **all and only the
cast ballots** from an election in one place. Let's say there are a hundred
boxes sitting on a pallet, with security guards and live web cams.

Ask yourself, is there an **objective, theoretically correct tabulation** of
these ballots? Is there a 'right answer'? And so the job of the election
process is to come up with a set of procedures and devices to determine that
right answer?

Oddly, I say that the answer is "no". There's no 'right answer'. There's
**always subjectivity** involved. Why? Well let's take some examples, from
here in the US, but I say similar examples exist no matter how ballots are
designed and votes are counted.

For example, in most states there is a **requirement** that a paper ballot be
filled in by fully filling in the circles in front of the candidates that you
choose, and that there are no other marks on the ballot. In fact the rule is
that any stray marks on the ballot make it invalid and not counted.

In **practice** it happens often that a voter marks a circle part way, then
crosses that out and clearly marks another candidate. Or that a voter, instead
of filling the circle in front of their candidate, instead draws a big circle
around the candidate's name. Or that they fill in a write-in candidate, but
neglect to fill in the circle in front of the name. In each of these cases,
they have 'technically' and 'legally' made their ballot invalid. Theoretically
these ballots should not be counted.

Now here's where it gets **interesting** : in fact the purpose or goal of the
law is to capture '**voter intent** ' - what did the voter mean? Even if they
did not follow the instructions precisely, is it clear who they wanted to vote
for?

This is but one of many ways in which, even if the law is clear, the
adjudication of the ballot is _subject to interpretation_. **There is no
specific objective, theoretically correct tabulation of that ballot**. Wow.

So when the vote is close, the losing candidate has a chance to argue about
each voter's intent based on what they scribbled on the ballot. That's why
recounts can go on and on [and end up in the Supreme Court.  
](<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/20/coleman-appeals-
election_n_189170.html>) And that's why the question of what the 'true' count
is of an election in the final analysis doesn't have a real objective answer.
(Even you can guarantee (**which you can 't)** that you have all and only the
legally voted ballots in a particular election, another 'fact' that actually
doesn't have an objective meaning.)

understand from fairly extensive, but still non-expert, study of how elections
work.]_
