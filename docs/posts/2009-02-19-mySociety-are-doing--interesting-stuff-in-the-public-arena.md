A british organization (or should I say organisation?) called mySociety has
done some **really cool** publically minded open source projects.

Sites like [FixMyStreet](<http://www.fixmystreet.com/>) and
[WhatDoTheyKnow](<http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/>) make so much sense and it
would seem to me could **easily be done** here in the USA.

**How about** it, shall we do it. It **doesn 't seem too hard**!

Check out this post by Tom Steinberg where he muses about how they might be
even able to do more: [Why I Want a Million
Quid](<http://www.mysociety.org/2009/02/19/why-i-want-a-million-quid/>):

> "One of our key insights has started to become a hindrance. We love sites
> like FixMyStreet partly because they show how wonderful success can be
> achieved at implausibly low cost: about £6000 in the case of that site.

> They take maintenance, sure, many tens of thousands of pounds a year once
> you have a number of such sites, but they are essentially elegant, scaleable
> small pieces of the web ecosystem.

> We love them partly because they are so small and simple, and that affection
> can lead to a dangerous narrative that only small and zero-cost scalable can
> ever be seriously considered." ( **from:** from
