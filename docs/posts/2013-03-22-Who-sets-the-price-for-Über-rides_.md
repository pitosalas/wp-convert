I've used the now-famous internetty car service Über a couple of times. The
prices for the two rides I took were about 20-25% more expensive than taxis.
Which made me **wonder about how the prices are set** for Über rides. Are they
set in Silicon Valley by some all-knowing **limousine wizard?** Does it allow
for competition, that is, can an enterprising Über-enabled driver choose to
offer a lower price?

I worry because if Über actually becomes dominant they could through monopoly
drive up the prices of black cars (which we used to call limousines, but that
sounds too fancy I guess.) Could they in turn drive up the prices of regular
taxi cabs?
