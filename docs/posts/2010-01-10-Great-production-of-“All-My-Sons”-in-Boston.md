I've been a subscriber at the Huntington Theater for years and years now and
this new play is the best one by far this season and one of the best in the
last few years.

["All My Sons" by Arthur Miller, at the Huntington Theater in Boston, MA,
USA](<http://feeds.feedburner.com/UrbanPlanningBlog>)

I have to say that the productions at the Huntington recently have been uneven
at best. I don't know whether my tastes have changed or whether something's
different but I more often leave with a "meh" than with a "yay!".

Last night was a Yay! [I recommend going to the Huntington Theater in Boston
to see "All My
Sons"](<http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/0910/sons/press.aspx>)
