This, from American Airlines:

> "Your trip is eligible for check-in now. Save time at the airport and check-
> in on AA.comÂ® any time from now up to one hour prior to your departure. To
> use our new instant check-in feature, simply click the button below and
> print your boarding pass. Save this email and use your personal check-in
> button for quick and easy check-in for your return flight."

Anyone have any idea what possible benefit I get for checking in online? I
don't think any of these

  * Save Time? How? I still have to go show my Id before getting my boarding pass don't I?

  * Checked bags? Still have to go to the counter as usual, don't I?

Checking in online seems cool, but why???
