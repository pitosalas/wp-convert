product of the Janet Jackson flap, was that [Tivo announced through a press
release](<http://www.tivo.com/5.3.1.1.asp?article=200>) that they registered

information at that **granular** level - literally what buttons I am pushing
on the remote? Big Brother! I guess the second, smaller surprise, is that

release**.
