**Link: [Efficient multi-SONAR with Arduino-like systems – Wimble Robotics](https://wimblerobotics.wimble.org/wp/2022/11/08/efficient-multi-sonar-with-arduino-like-systems/):** "A bit esoteric Robotics article. It explains how one roboticist handles multiple ultrasonic sensors, using a clever polling and interrupt driven scheme."
