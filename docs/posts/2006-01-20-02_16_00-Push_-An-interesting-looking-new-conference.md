>> I met Cecily Sommers at the Pop!Tech conference earlier this year. She
heads up a new conference that I had read about previously, called
**[Push](<http://www.pushthefuture.org/welcome.asp>)**. According to what I'd
read, it was what Ted was 10 years ago or Pop!Tech was 2 years ago.

>>

>> Here's a pretty strong endorsement:

>>

>>> "PUSH jumped onto our schedule this year because of the enthusiasm of past
attendees. Our sources were correct…(it was like) a " **mini-Davos** " located
in Minnesota's Twin Cities, with a relentlessly diverse audience came from all
over the world[…] We'll be **back** next year." ( **from** [Sam Perry,
Conferenza Premium Reports](<http://www.pushthefuture.org/welcome.asp>))

>>

>> And here's Shel Israel:

>>

>>> "PUSH is a **brainfood** conference. It gathers top-notched movers and
thinkers like TED or PopTech. There are a few differences that I like. It has
a smaller attendance and a lower price tag (which is lower still with a
special offer)." (
**from**[ItSeemsToMe](<http://seems2shel.typepad.com/itseemstome/2005/04/i_recommend_the.html>))

>>

>> I haven't been myself but the web site looks quite intriguing. Cecily is
cool. So, if you are thinking of going, you can use this discount code:
