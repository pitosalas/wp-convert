As I said in the previous post, I am a bit of a promiscuous signer upper. From
a cursory look, Rhapsody and Spotify are fairly similar. They both charge $10
per month for unlimited listening to all kinds of music. I saw a few blog
posts that took one side or the other.

With all the geek news about spotify, one would like to know more. So, I
capriciously cancelled my Rhapsody and am now trying the new thing.

That's a problem they both have. No stickiness whatsoever. I know that for
example the Sonos product supports Rhapsody. If I had spent $1000's of dollars
on a Sonos set up (like friends of mine have) AND Sonos didn't support
Spotify, then I might think twice. But here, it's just another bit of software
to set up and play with.

I will report back!
