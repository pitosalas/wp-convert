>> Dave Sifry, of [Technorati](<http://www.technorati.com/>), periodically
reports **interesting statistics** about how the world of blogging is growing
and changing. He's in a **unique position** to do this, because Technorati is
one of the leading crawlers and indexers of the blogosphere, so Dave has great
access to lots and lots of data. And then, he does a great job **analyzing**
what it all might mean.

>> Dave recently published [another
report](<http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000432.html>). Here are some fun
tidbits. All of these **quoted from** "[Sifry's Alerts: State of the
Blogosphere, April 2006, Part
