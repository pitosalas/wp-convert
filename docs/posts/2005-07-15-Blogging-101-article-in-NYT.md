[Scripting News:
7/15/2005](<http://archive.scripting.com/2005/07/15#When:9:36:10AM>): Dave
points to the New York Times article by [Rich Meslin, Blogs
101](<http://www.nytimes.com/ref/technology/blogs_101.html>). It's a very nice
collection of Blogs of general interest as a good introduction to the world of
Blogs.

sites. Most blogs carry links to other blogs on related topics or that the
author likes. This page is under development; feel free to suggest your own
finds. Business and sports suggestions are particularly welcome." (**from**

**OPML** as well? Technorati Tags: [blog](<http://technorati.com/tag/blog>),
