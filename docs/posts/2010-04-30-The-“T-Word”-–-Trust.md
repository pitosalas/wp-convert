I am not sure exactly what this [article about
Trust](<http://www.cringely.com/2010/04/the-t-word/>) means exactly, but it's
thought provoking, don't you think?

> zero. When trust is non-zero (which is better, believe me) it is based on
> one of two methodologies — empiricism or transparency (the other T-word)." (
