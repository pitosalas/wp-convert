# [The “T Word” – Trust](None)




I am not sure exactly what this [article about
Trust](<http://www.cringely.com/2010/04/the-t-word/>) means exactly, but it's
thought provoking, don't you think?

> "Trust is present or it is absent. Grab a nerd and he’ll tell you that even
> the absence of trust is a measure of trust and that particular measure is
> zero. When trust is non-zero (which is better, believe me) it is based on
> one of two methodologies — empiricism or transparency (the other T-word)." (
