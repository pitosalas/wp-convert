>> I was recently asked by a VC friend of mine what I thought of a certain
Wiki product. I thought my response to him (with specific product and people
references removed) might be interesting. He asked me, " _Have you kept track
of what 's going on in Wiki-land, and what do you think?"_

>>

>> Here's my **answer** :

>>

>> Yes, I have very much kept track of the wiki stuff. After doing eRoom,
which is still among the best collab systems out there in my (humble) opinion,
I very much believe that there's a **whole next generation of collaboration**
that is needed. I say this because eRoom and others fall really short when it
comes to get mass adoption. Wiki's might point in that direction.

>>

>> That said, **I think Wikis today are abominable**. They have a few
breakthrough ideas, certainly, but other than that they are IMHO very hard to
use and will in **their current form be adopted by few**. Also in my opinion,
in terms of enterprise adoption, they will suffer the **same challenges that
eRoom** and all the others do: customers don't really experience enough pain
collaborating as they do today over email and IM. They are and will continue
to be **hard pressed** to spend real money on solving the 'collaboration'
problem.

>>

>> The more **likely strategy** , still, is one of **verticalization** :
understanding specific use scenarios, building specialized flavors of
collaboration stuff, and marrying this with the right marketing strategy and
sales approach.
