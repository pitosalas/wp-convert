–This is a pretty amazing article. Even though it's "non technical" and I read
all of it, I think I only understood about 75%: "Stephen Wolfram explores the
broader picture of what's going on inside ChatGPT and why it produces
meaningful text. Discusses models, training neural nets, embeddings, tokens,
transformers, language syntax."
