I am going to share my **secret technology** for losing weight. It's a mental
exercise that really works. It is inspired by the neuro-economics concept of
"[anchoring](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring>)". Here's how it works:

Every morning you step on your scale, right? I do. Well let's say my weight
yesterday was 171lbs. Let's say my goal weight is 165lbs. Before stepping on
the scale, I **think** "165" and **visualize** seeing "165" on the read out.
Then I step on the scale. I

see, let's say, 170.5lbs. I am not surprised, but **part of my subconscious is
disappointed** and I am re-motivated to keep working on it. My focus and
motivation is pumped up. It works! (**Patent pending 2011, R. Pito Salas)**

Before this technique, I would step on the scale thinking, I hope that I am
maybe half a pound less than yesterday, but anyway, it better not be up. So
then I see 170.5lbs. And I am **relieved and proud**. My focus and motivation
flags.

Hadn't heard about anchoring before? Here's a bit about it:

> "During normal decision-making, anchoring occurs when individuals overly
> rely on a specific piece of information to govern their thought-process.
> Once the anchor is set, there is a bias toward adjusting or interpreting
> other information to reflect the "anchored" information. Through this
> cognitive bias, the first information learned about a subject (or, more
> generally, information learned at an early age) can affect future decision-
> making and information analysis." (**from**
> [Wikipedia](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring>))

And also:

> "Take the last three digits of your social security number. Turn those
> numbers into a dollar value (i.e., if your numbers are 462 then they provide
> a value of $462). Consider whether you would be willing to pay that dollar
> amount for a first edition of JRR Tolkienâs, The Hobbit. Now, how much
> would you actually pay for a first edition original copy?
>
> A stylized result from laboratory experiments in economics and psychology is
> that a subjectâs answer to the latter valuation question is strongly
> influenced by the dollar amount computed from their social security numbers,
> whether for ordinary consumer products or exotic goods.1 Based on the
> premise that the randomly determined value should contain no useful
> information, critics of neoclassical theory have argued that such findings
> refute the notion that decision makersâ preferences are consistent and
> stable.
>
> A natural conclusion is that if preferences are unduly labile and influenced
> by innocuous properties of circumstance, then no optimization principles may
> underlie even straightforward individual economic decisions." (**from**
