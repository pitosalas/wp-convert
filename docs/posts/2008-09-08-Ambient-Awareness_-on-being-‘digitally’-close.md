# [Ambient Awareness: on being ‘digitally’ close](None)




A [good article in the New York Times Magazine about the so-called 'ambient
awareness'
phenomenon](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html>):

> "Social scientists have a name for this sort of incessant online contact.
> They call it “ambient awareness.” It is, they say, very much like being
> physically near someone and picking up on his mood through the little things
> he does — body language, sighs, stray comments — out of the corner of your
> eye. Facebook is no longer alone in offering this sort of interaction
> online." (from [New York Times: I am So Totally, Digitally Close to
> You")](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html>)

The [article](<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html>)
talks about the Facebook Friend Feed and how it originally was rejected by the
users, but soon became the key to a burst of growth of Facebook. Twitter is
also explored in detail. This is a good introductory article on the Twitter
phenomenon.
