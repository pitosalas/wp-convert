The demos at this year's DEMO are quite good. One interesting thing I noticed
is that there are
[several](<http://www.demo.com/demo2/demonstrators/audiotriev.html>) [products
](<http://www.demo.com/demo2/demonstrators/fortiva.html>)connected to keeping
companies out of legal trouble due to problematic internal and external
emails, or to help get them out of trouble if they get into it.

>>

>> In several demos we were treated to examples based on the "Enron internal
emails." The first two times I thought I was seeing a coincidental picking of
the same humor by two seperate companies.

>>

>> But when it came up again, I went searching, and wouldn't you know that
during the discovery process of the whole Enron debacle, an aparently
extensive (perhaps complete) collection of their internal emails during the
relevant periods were collected, and subsequently made public on the web.
[Here's an interesting paper, one of many, about te Enron Email
Corpus](<http://www.ceas.cc/papers-2004/168.pdf>)

>> So just **watch out** what you write in email!
