The other day, [Amazon released a free application on the iPhone (and iPod
Touch.) On the surface, just another ebook application.
](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_83811991_2?ie=UTF8&docId=1000301301&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=right-1&pf_rd_r=1YP113BP56SN3V5NAENM&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=471118251&pf_rd_i=133141011>)

The application is free. When you run it the first thing you do is to register
it to Amazon's web site (using your normal Amazon username and password - you
already have one, right?)  As far as the Amazon site goes, your iPhone is a
Kindle. It shows up on your list of Kindles. And you can buy books for it. So
now you can visit the [Kindle Store](<http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-
Wireless-Reading-
Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/ref=amb_link_83607871_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=1YP113BP56SN3V5NAENM&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=469527991&pf_rd_i=133141011>)
on Amazon and buy books (and free book samples)

Now on my iPhone, magically, those books appear on my book list, and I can
read them. There's a huge collection of books and particularly nice, free
initial chapters for a ton of books.

Here's the **genius** part: I get a free app, experience the [Amazon Kindle
Store](<http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-
blogs/b/ref=topnav_storetab_kinc?ie=UTF8&node=133141011>), get a bunch of free
books and read them on my iPhone. The iPhone is a crappy ebook reader. The
screen is too small: Solution: **I guess I need a Kindle.** Genius.
