In the past, clever **[tag]entrepreneurs[/tag]** (yours truly not included,
alas) have built companies and products with a very specific plan or desire or
hope or scheme to be acquired by some deep pocketed parent-to-be.

Perhaps create a bit of MS Windows Software that looked just like an Office
App, interoperated beautifully with Microsoft apps, was written in C#, didn't
run on anything but Windows, hoping to catch the eye of Microsoft (remember
Visio?). Well I am sure this is still going on with
[Microsoft](<http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx>), especially since
Balmer announced that MSFT will be acquiring 100 companies per year (quantity
over quality?)

But lately the cool kids decided that Ajax, Web 2.0, mass market, "we'll make
it up in volume" was the road to Google's pocket-heart. And if
[Google](<http://www.google.com/>) didn't bite, well there was also Yahoo who
might (remember Flickr?)

Hey, I am not knocking it. It's a perfectly rational strategy.

Now [Flock 1.0](<http://www.flock.com/>) comes out and points the new way.
Facebook!

This is from a [very positive review of Flock
1.0](<http://blog.wedocreative.com/2007/10/web/why-flock-is-now-my-favorite-

Makes a lot of sense to me. Use the Facebook API to create an application or
site or product or service that looks exactly like something that they would
have developed themselves. This requires you to not only learn their technical
specs, but also their business strategy, their marketing, their customers. The
effect you want is that Facebook folks look and say, "Hey we should have
developed that."
