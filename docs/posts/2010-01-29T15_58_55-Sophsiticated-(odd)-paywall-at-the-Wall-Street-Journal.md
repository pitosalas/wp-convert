So I am trying to decide whether I should renew my subscription to Wall Street
Journal online. I read an article hear and there in the journal probably every
day but certainly not the whole paper. So I've been paying a little more
attention to what that subscription gets me.

Here are some interesting findings:

If I go to [www.wsj.com](<http://www.wsj.com>) (not logged in) and click on
["Apple's iPad Changes the landscape for App
makers"](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704194504575031561969855580.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection>)
I get a partial article with a message that I should subscribe if I want to
read the whole thing.

If I go to google and search for "[Apple's iPad Changes the landscape for App
makers"](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704194504575031561969855580.html?mod=rss_Today%27s_Most_Popular>)
I actually see the whole article!

If within that whole article, I click on the [print
link](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704194504575031561969855580.html?mod=rss_Today%27s_Most_Popular#printMode>),
lo and behold, I only get to print the first paragraph. (Of course I could
print the full article myself without using the print link.)

On the other hand if I go to www.wsj.com and click on [Kim
Strassel's](<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704878904575031640091592622.html>)
article in the opinion section, I get the whole thing without needing to log
in.

Pretty fancy. Are they over thinking it?
