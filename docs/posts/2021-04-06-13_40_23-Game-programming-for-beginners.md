(**Web site except:** In these series of tutorials I will explain new java concepts of an intermediate level (threads, AWT, Swing, etc.) and basic concepts for game programming (game loop, FPS, sprite, etc). These tutorials are useful both for those who want to program games, as for those who, with a basic or intermediate level in java, want to learn and improve java programming concepts in an entertaining way.)
