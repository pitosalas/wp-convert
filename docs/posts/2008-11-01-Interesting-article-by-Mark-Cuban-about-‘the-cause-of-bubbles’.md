Whether you agree or not, it is [thoughtful and thought provoking discussion
of Bubbles and Financial Engineering](<http://blogmaverick.com/2008/10/11/the-
cause-of-bubbles-investment-vs-financial-engineering/>)  (IMO):

> "Let me get this straight.  In 2008, funds trying to squeeze out another
> basis point or two thought they were being conservative  buying insurance on
> heavily leveraged portfolios of sub prime loans and other debt. Once those
> loans started to default, it  created a cascading deleveraging event which
> lead to major financial institutions failing and the “smartest” minds on
> Wall Street being forced to dump everything to raise cash, which in turn
> lead to a crisis of confidence and deleveraging that created the worst week
> in the history of the stock markets. Did I get this right ?" (from [Blog
