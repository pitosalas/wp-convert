title: "How easy is it to cheat?"

I've gotten very interested in Election Reform lately, and I've delved into
how the overall voting system works, technically but also politically and
procedurally. There are so many simple and not so simple ways in which
election results can be manipulated that it makes my head spin.

I was at FooCamp this weekend and told this story to many people, so I thought
I'd give some pointers to this particular example of how voters using touch
screen devices could be cheated out of their vote.

This is far from the only exampleâ€¦Concerned?
