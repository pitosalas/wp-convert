[ The Ultimate Guide to Real-Time Lane Detection Using OpenCV – Automatic
Addison](<https://automaticaddison.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-real-time-lane-
detection-using-opencv/>)

In this tutorial, we will go through the entire process, step by step, of how
to detect lanes on a road in real time using the OpenCV computer vision
library and Python. By the end of this tutorial, you will know how to build
(from scratch) an application that can automatically detect lanes in a video
stream from a front-facing camera mounted on a car. You’ll be able to generate
this video below.
