# [A9’s Photographic Yellow Pages](None)


[Quite a bit](<http://blogs.linux.ie/xeer/2005/01/27/a9com-yellow-pages-
copyrighted-buildings/>) [has been
written](<http://softtechvc.blogs.com/software_only/2005/01/a9_yellow_pages.html>)
about this, so I won't repeat except to relate my experience in setting up a
breakfast with a friend of mine. [Here is the link I sent him (so now you know
where, but you don't know
when!)](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0003GKFQK/002-5349435-1904851?>)!

>> Amusing to see the photo and the map of the place, isn't it?
