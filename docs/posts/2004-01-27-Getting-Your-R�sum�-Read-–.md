Spolsky](<http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html>). **Joel
writes a good and amusing article with some brain-dead-obvious tips (that

other punctuation**. Attention, the entire population of India: whenever you
have a comma, there is always exactly one space and it's always after the
comma and never before it. Thank you." _

>> While still amusing (but perhaps somewhat culturally insensitive) this
particular point stands out because I've had this debate/argument more than
once. In particular the old **typewriter** -induced habit of placing **TWO
spaces after a period** , which in my book is **incorrect**. But apparently
this is not universal - there are up to date style guides which insist on the
old monospace font two spaces after a period. (Via Dave Winer and _everyone
else too!)_

up to the top of Blogdex. Geez, it's so hard to be original!
