# [[GEEKY] Too much authentication goodness](None)




It seems like nowadays, to be a cool, 21st century kind of application, you
need to allow me to use my facebook, or google, or yahoo, or twitter, or â€¦
account to access a site. Ok, sounds like a fine idea, don't you think?

Here's the problem. I go to one of the zillions of sites out there that I use,
and it asks me to log in. Now, not only do I have to remember a username /
email, a password, but I also have to remember if I used Google, Facebook,
OpenId, or whatnot, to get in.

I guess I should set a policy for myself to never use anything other than the
built in username/password. That's probably a better policy for security as
well.
