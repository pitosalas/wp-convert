**Link: [How (not) to design a ballot](None):** ""



My head is full of democracy and elections these days. How come, you ask? Well
for the last year or so I've been working for the Open Source Digital Voting
Foundation, on elections technology. This month's focus is generating ballots
for two elections happening in November. So more than usual, I am dreaming in
black and white forms. Anywayâ€¦

I came across a couple of instructive blog posts about the new non-lever
voting that New York unveiled this month. Predictably, when dealing with
humans, some people don't like them. You can't please them all, right? But
really the objections raised here are quite legitimate.

If this important yet rather esoteric topic interests you, here are three good
links:
