>> "I'll be the first to admit it: I know next to nothing about MySpace or
Facebook. I do know that they're social networking sites, and that -- at least
to some extent -- your reputation is based on who are your "friends" and what
they say about you.

>>

>> Which means that [this](<http://www.fakeyourspace.com/>) follows, like day
follows night. "Fake Your Space" is a site where you can "hire" fake friends
to leave their pictures and personalized comments on your page." (from:
