# [How to add a map to any blog page](None)


I came across this interesting bit in [LifeHacker:
](<http://www.lifehacker.com>) [WikiMapia - The geographical wikipedia -
Lifehacker](<http://www.lifehacker.com/software/google-maps/wikimapia--the-
geographical-wikipedia-176634.php> "WikiMapia - The geographical wikipedia -
Lifehacker").

>> It teaches that using WikiMapia, you can **add a map** to any web page in
30 seconds. If that claim is true, then you should be seeing a map of where
**I was born** below. If you don't see that map, then ignore this post, please
🙂

>> p.s. **It worked!!!** Just shows that there's nothing you can't get from
the internet, and that Google Maps is unbelievably cool!
