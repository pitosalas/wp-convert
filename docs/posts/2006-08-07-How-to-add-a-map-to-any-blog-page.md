I came across this interesting bit in [LifeHacker:
](<http://www.lifehacker.com>) [WikiMapia - The geographical wikipedia -
Lifehacker](<http://www.lifehacker.com/software/google-maps/wikimapia--the-
geographical-wikipedia-176634.php> "WikiMapia - The geographical wikipedia -
Lifehacker"). It teaches that using WikiMapia, you can **add a map** to any
web page in 30 seconds. If that claim is true, then you should be seeing a map
of where **I was born** below. If you don't see that map, then ignore this
post, please ðŸ™‚

p.s. **It worked!!!** Just shows that there's nothing you can't get from the
internet, and that Google Maps is unbelievably cool! Technorati Tags:
