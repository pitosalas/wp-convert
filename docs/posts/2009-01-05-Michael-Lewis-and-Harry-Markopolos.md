# [Michael Lewis and Harry Markopolos](None)




In an excellent article on [The End of The Financial World as We Know
It](<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/opinion/04lewiseinhorn.html?em>), an
even more fascinating story about Harry Markopolos:

> In his devastatingly persuasive 17-page letter to the S.E.C., Mr. Markopolos
> saw two possible scenarios. In the “Unlikely” scenario: Mr. Madoff, who
> acted as a broker as well as an investor, was “front-running” his brokerage
> customers. A customer might submit an order to Madoff Securities to buy
> shares in I.B.M. at a certain price, for example, and Madoff Securities
> instantly would buy I.B.M. shares for its own portfolio ahead of the
> customer order. If I.B.M.’s shares rose, Mr. Madoff kept them; if they fell
> he fobbed them off onto the poor customer.
>
> **In the “Highly Likely” scenario, wrote Mr. Markopolos, “Madoff Securities
> is the world’s largest Ponzi Scheme.”** Which, as we now know, it was.

Wow!
