Pricing software is a perennial challenge. I came across this ebook, ["Don't
just roll the dice" by Neil
Davidson.](<http://www.neildavidson.com/dontjustrollthedice.html>) It's a very
nice introduction to a tricky topic. I am considering a major revamp of the
[BlogBridge](<http://www.blogbridge.com>) web site, with pricing and feature
changes and this guide helps me think through those questions.
