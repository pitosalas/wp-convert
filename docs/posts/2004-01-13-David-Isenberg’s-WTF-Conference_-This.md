>>> _…. Here's the idea -- an instant, bottom-up meeting. WTF.  Let's get
together face to face. Let's talk about the end of telephony and the beginning
of communication, about the end-to-end principle and its enemies, about smart
people and dumb companies, intellectual property and creative commons, digital
democracy and info-surveillance, e-commerce and the war against customers, and
whatever else is on our minds. Let's get to know each other, learn from each
other, exchange ideas, frustrations, tools, toys and hacks. And let's see what
happens from there. WTF -- it'll be lots more exciting than talking corporate
heads behind podiums….._
