[ Ruby 3.2’s YJIT is Production-Ready](< https://shopify.engineering/ruby-
yjit-is-production-ready>) –My question is what does the Y in YJIT stand for?
From the author: "YJIT, a just-in-time (JIT) implementation on top of CRuby
built at Shopify, is now production-ready and delivering major improvements to
performance and speed. Maxime shares the updates that have been made in this
newest version of YJIT, and future plans for further optimization."
