For you slow pokes who have not yet upgraded to Leopard, my continuing
experience might be of interest (then again it may not.) If you are a real
slow poke you may not know that Leopard is Apple's new generation operating
system for the Mac line. My reference above to Vista is mostly tongue-in-
cheek. Here's what my log book says so far:

  * Tried to upgrade my old iBook G4. The DVD spent a long time making reading noises but nothing seemed to happen. Waited about 4 hours. Then gave up. Couldn't get the DVD out - the iBook continued to book back to the DVD. Called Apple. Got a barely trained tech on the phone that really annoyed me. Finally figured it out myself.

  * Leopard doesn't like getting installed on a 4 year old iBook with 256M of memory. Duh. Why didn't it just say so?

  * Next upgraded my 2 year old Mac G5 tower. Went, soup to nuts, with no hiccups at all. Wonderful.

Next post: What's different that matters in Leopard, at least to me.
