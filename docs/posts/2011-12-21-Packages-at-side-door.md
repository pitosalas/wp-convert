For no apparent reason, my Holiday packages are being **delivered to our side
door**. We've had that side door for 10 years and no one has ever used it,
especially not for package delivery. I wonder if this is a new anti-scrooge-
thief policy from the UPS, Fedex and USPS's of the world? See [Holiday
