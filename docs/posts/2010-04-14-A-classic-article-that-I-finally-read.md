**Link: [A classic article that I finally read](None):** ""



The article "[Reflections on Trusting Trust](<http://cm.bell-
labs.com/who/ken/trust.html>)" is often mentioned in conversation and cited. I
finally tracked down and read this classic, and it is indeed a classic of
computer science. And typically for classics, it's short, clear, readable and
impactful:

> "The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create
> yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ peoplelike me.) No
> amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using
> untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this kind of attack, I
> picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any program-handling
> program such as an assembler, a loader, or even hardware microcode. As the
> level of program gets lower, these bugs will be harder and harder to detect.
> A well installed microcode bug will be almost impossible to detect." (
