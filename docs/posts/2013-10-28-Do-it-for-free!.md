Tim Kreider's essay could apply as easily to all those people who complain
that an iPhone app is not free, or is so so expensive at $5.99. Not too long
ago a piece of software would get $99 or $495. Makes you wonder how long Adobe
can keep on charging through the nose for Photoshop and Illustrator. Anyway,
here's a bit of the article:

> "People who would consider it a bizarre breach of conduct to expect anyone
> to give them a haircut or a can of soda at no cost will ask you, with a
> straight face and a clear conscience, whether you wouldn't be willing to
> write an essay or draw an illustration for them for nothing. They often
> start by telling you how much they admire your work, although not enough,
> evidently, to pay one cent for it. "Unfortunately we don't have the budget
> to offer compensation to our contributorsâ€¦" is how the pertinent line
> usually starts. But just as often, they simply omit any mention of payment."
