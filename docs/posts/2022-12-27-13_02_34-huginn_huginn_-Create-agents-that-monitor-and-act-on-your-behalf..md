[ huginn/huginn: Create agents that monitor and act on your behalf.](<
https://github.com/huginn/huginn#getting-started>) –Interesting package
although I don't have a use for it yet. It's your own IFTTT built for geeks
that you run on your ownn server. It's got no UI to speak of. On the other
hand, it has a sophisticated way to create logic around events and is
extensible and open source.
