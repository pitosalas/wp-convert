>> A friend of mine who used to work at **Microsoft** sent me a link to a
[very interesting
posting](<http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/working_at_microsoft.html>)
about what it's like to work there. If you're interested in the big MSFT, you
might enjoy reading this. Here's one telling bit:

>>

>>> "I joined Microsoft at the beginning of the antitrust litigation against
the company. My NASA coworkers made all sorts of derogatory comments about my
choice. I remember one began a conversation with "So you've decided to go work
for The **Great Satan** , huh?" A lot of people who ought to know better are
convinced Microsoft is evil. Apologies if you're one of them -- because these
people are **idiots**." ( **from** [Working at
Microsoft](<http://www.qbrundage.com/michaelb/pubs/essays/working_at_microsoft.html>))

>>

>> At [eRoom](<http://software.emc.com/microsites/eRoom/index.jsp>) we were
always like a **tiny** little boat bobbing around a **whale** called
**Microsoft**. I **never** thought Microsoft was **evil** or had it out for us
or anything like that. The metaphor was more like, Microsoft is this **huge**
, **goofy** , well **-** intentioned giant, not really able to be **aware** or
**worry** about what happened to every little creature every time they decided
to **inhale** or roll **over**.
