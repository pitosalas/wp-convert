> "It’s every developer’s worse nightmare. You’ve bet the farm on a
> development framework, spent thousands of person-hours developing your
> application and then find a memory leak. Worse yet, you’ve got a memory leak
> in an interpreted scripting environment where you have little to no control
> over how memory is allocated and managed at runtime." ( **from** [Tracking a
