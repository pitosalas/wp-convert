This is relevant to the discussion about [congestion pricing, mesh networks
and avoiding traffic jams](</2008/03/22/what-does-urban-congestion-have-to-do-
with-mesh-networks/>), a topic that I am getting interested in as you could
see from this previous post.

Read the whole article and you will see that [it's more than just GPS devices
that are being called to
duty](<http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10843094>):

overall picture of where the traffic is and how to avoid it.
