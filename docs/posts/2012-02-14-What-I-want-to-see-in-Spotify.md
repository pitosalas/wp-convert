**Link: [What I want to see in Spotify](None):** ""

As you know, I am a big big fan of Spotify. Lately I've been playing with the
Last.FM integration. It's a handy way for me to see what new music or artists
I might like to listen to. I've discovered plenty of new music that way, it's
great.

What I would like is to be able to ask Spotify (or Last.FM) for a 'radio'
station which plays music that I might like to hear. This feature exists but
it doesn't suit me because it would jump from a raucous rock piece to a quiet
jazz piece to a strange folk piece. Generally I play music based on a general
mood I am in or want. Quiet Jazz in the morning and upbeat stuff (load) when I
am washing dishes. You get the idea.

If you work for Spotify, what do you think?
