>> Glad to see that [Ray is blogging
again](<http://spaces.msn.com/members/rayozzie/>). Now that he is at Microsoft
running the big new initiative this should be a really interesting one to
follow!

>>> "A couple of weeks ago, Bill and I brought life to a new initiative that,
over the course of the months and years ahead, will catalyze and deliver a
number of things that I'm very excited about. At that event, I said that
unlike many other stealth projects I've/we've done, in this case many of our
plans and offerings will evolve progressively and in the open, shaped in good
measure by a dialog with you." ( **from** [Ray Ozzie's
Blog](<http://spaces.msn.com/members/rayozzie/>))
