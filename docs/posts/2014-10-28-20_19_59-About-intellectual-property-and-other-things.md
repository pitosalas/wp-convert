I came across a wonderful quote about intellectual property. I am not sure I
agree with it myself but wanted to share it. It is from [Carsie Blanton's blog
post "New Rules for the Music Business"](<http://blog.carsieblanton.com>) and
it goes like this:

> "“Intellectual property” is an absurd concept that only a society of
> clueless, museless marketers could possibly conceive of. It’s an idea that
> serves markets, cripples muses, and is willfully ignorant of all of human
> history.
>
> We are stealing from one another constantly and shamelessly, and that’s a
> blessed and beautiful thing. Every folk song is a mashup of all previous
> folk songs. Every film stands on the shoulders of all other films. Every
> sentence, poem and novel exists only for the creative gumption of all
> previous speakers of language, which is itself a collaborative invention of
> the entire human race. The whole history of human invention is characterized
> by a kind of joyful, infinite plagiarism.
>
> Ideas are not commodities. They are made to be shared, not owned.
>
> That said, I do get the point. If somebody covered one of my songs and got

> And it’s time for all of us to get real, real comfortable with the former."

What I like about this is that it straddles both my impulse that ideas are not
commodities and that everything I create is built upon the shoulders of those
who came before. Or as I like to say "Ideas are cheap". But on the other hand,
if you figure out that you can make money from my creations then there is a
basis in fairness that I get some of the benefit of it. Schizophrenic, I know,
but it captures it nicely.
