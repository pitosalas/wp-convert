You should read this book: [Confessions of an Economic Hit
Man](<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0452287081&linkCode=as2&tag=blogbridge-20>)![](http://ir-
na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0452287081).  It's
shocking and insightful.

Basically the book explains and teaches that when you hear, for example, that
Egypt is getting a billion US$ in military aid, that's not what it sounds
like. We are not sending them a check for a million bucks. We are actually
sending the million bucks to US millitary corporations.

Why? Because the funds that Egypt gets can only be spent with specific US
companies on specific items, either hardware or service contracts. And
moreover the books explains that often the recipient country doesn't even want
what they are required to purchase or the project that they are required to
undertake, lets say a new highway, bridge, airport or whatever.

So read the book and also, keep that in mind when you learn for example that
