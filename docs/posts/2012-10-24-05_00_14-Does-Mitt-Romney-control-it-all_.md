[Another conspiracy](<http://truth-out.org/news/item/12204-does-the-romney-
family-now-own-your-e-vote>) story claiming that Romney through several levels
of company, controls a company that makes a type of voting machine that is
used in many parts of the country:

> "Through a closely held equity fund called Solamere, Mitt Romney and his
> wife, son and brother are major investors in an investment firm called
> H.I.G. Capital. H.I.G. in turn holds a majority share and three out of five
> board members in Hart Intercivic, a company that owns the notoriously faulty
> electronic voting machines that will count the ballots in swing state Ohio
> November 7. Hart machines will also be used elsewhere in the United States.

I **haven 't checked into this** to determine if it's true.

And even if it is, it's a **bit of a stretch** to believe that this indirect
corporate 'control' leads to high odds that the vote would be manipulated.
