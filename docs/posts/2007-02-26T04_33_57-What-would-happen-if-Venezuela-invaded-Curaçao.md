Yeah a weird thought. So when I came across an [analysis called The Dutch
Defend Their World
Empire](<http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htworld/articles/20070225.aspx>), I
was fascinated, in a sick sort of way.

> "[snip…]The Dutch problem can best be described with the words, "not

> logistical support to support an operation.[snip…] ( **from** [The Dutch

Also, from the comments:  

> "[snip…]The United States would love nothing more than to see Chavez booted
