**Link: [Finally updating to Leopard](None):** ""

Usually more on the bleeding edge than this, I decided to wait until now to
upgrade my macs to Leopard which is the name of the new Mac OS X release. If
anything interesting happens I will let you know. Hopefully nothing
interesting will happen ðŸ™‚

  * Why does the Leopard update begins with an exhaustive and lengthy "checking of the DVD for consistency"? process? I haven't heard much about DVDs getting mysteriously turned inconsistent. Maybe they are doing something else and just making up a more tolerable exuse for the 30 minute do-nothing delay.

  * I have a 4 year old iMac G4 notebook. I wonder if Leopard will like it.
