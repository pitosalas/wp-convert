Ethan Zuckerman's blog is more like a magazine of insightful, well written
papers. I liked [From compassion to action, from action to
knowledge](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2009/11/19/from-compassion-to-
action-from-action-to-knowledge/>). Here's a key bit:

> "If the inability to act makes us bored, cynical and apathetic, is it
> possible that doing something – even something that’s ultimately ineffective
> – could keep us engaged and compassionate? If so, is there an interplay
> between action and information-gathering that could turn a story into a
> movement that builds public will?" ( **from** [From compassion to action,
> from action to
> knowledge](<http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2009/11/19/from-compassion-
> to-action-from-action-to-knowledge/>))
