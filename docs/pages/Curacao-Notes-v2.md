## What is this?

As I am always asked for tips on doing stuff in Curaçao, I thought I would write them down here.

Beware that all this is just my own, biased, weird, opinions. There are perfectly good restaurants, even popular ones, that I don't like because of the atmosphere or the price or the location. There are restaurants considered boring, that I like, for the same reasons. So buyer beware.

## Geography and Weather

Curacao  is a very small island. It's about 40 miles long and about 5 miles wide. It's as if you cut off Cape Cod at the Canal and straightened it out. However the roads are not as good. Still, the longest drive you can make without doubling back is around 45 minutes.

It's basically tropical. Or desert. It's always around 80 degrees and with a good breeze. In the "summer" there's almost never rain, sunny, blue skies every day. In the "winter" it might rain a little more.

If you wear shorts, bring multiple sets. I wear only shorts almost all the time. No need for a sweater of any kind.

Bring sunglasses, a hat, and suntan lotion!

Driving is pretty easy. Google maps will work, better still if you download the maps so you don't need to use your data plan. Driving is on the right, just like the USA. However the signs will not all be familiar, but common sense. Yes people drive a little crazy but really not more than Boston.

## Outside


### Must Do Site Seeing

* [Snoa](https://snoa.com) - Mikve Israel Emmanuel Synagogue. You know, where I had my Bar Mitzvah. Very interesting building and history.
* [West Punt](https://exploringcuracao.com/10-best-things-to-do-in-westpunt-curacao/) - The western most tip of the island. Because it's a small island, westernmost is really not that far. If it wasn't for traffic you could get from Punda to West Punt in 30 minutes.
* [Boca Tabla](https://www.shetebokapark.org) - Shete Boka (7 mouths) includes the fantastic cave in/on top of/the very rocky and rough North coast of the island. As usual, remember that it is sunny and the sun is bright and hot. It will be very windy. THe place looks like a moonscape!

### Things to do and see

* [Alma Blau Art Gallery](https://museumsofcuracao.org/museum/gallery-alma-blou/) - Lovely local art gallery
* [ATV Tours](https://www.atvbuggytours.com) - This is one of many. It is a popular activity but I've never tried it myself. Remember it is very hot and the sun is always out. So keep that in mind.
* [Black Sand Beach](https://curacao.for91days.com/the-black-sand-beach-of-santu-pretu/) - Kind of cool but not as black as the Hawaii black sand beaches.
* [Blue Room](https://adventuretourscuracao.com/tour/curacao-blue-room-tour/) - Unique snorkling spot. Only accessible by water. You take a boat tour out to it and then jump in. Memorable. 
* [Christoffel Park](https://www.christoffelpark.org/hiking-trails) - Nice walk hike, but don't climb to the top, it's too hot.
* [Den Dunki](https://www.inyourpocket.com/Curacao/Den-Dunki-National-Park_110184v)  - Nice walk hike, salt flats (zout pannen). There is a personal story connected with this place that I can tell you about. 
* [Dina's Botanical and Historic Garden](https://museumsofcuracao.org/museum/den-paradera-dinahs-herb-garden/) - If you are into natural remedies, growing herbs and tropical plants.
* [Historical Harbor Tour](https://curacao.for91days.com/a-tour-of-the-schottegat-harbor/) - Wednesdays at 2pm, really interesting tour looking at history, industry, polution etc.
* [Hoffi Mango](https://hofimango.com) - Have not been but I am told it is a very nice walk/hike.
* [Hoffi Pastor](https://www.hofipastor.org/hulphofi.htm) - Have not been but I am told it is a very nice walk/hike.

* [Sunset Boat Tour](https://adventuretourscuracao.com/tour/curacao-sunset-boat-trip/) - Haven't tried myself but comes highly recommended.

### Beaches

The word in Papiamento for beach is `playa`. This list is certainluy not a list of all the beaches. There are many more. These are the ones that I like and have been to. I would recommend any of them.

* [Blau Baai](https://www.bluebay-curacao.com/activities/beach) - Restaurant and beach
* [Blau Beach](https://www.bluebay-curacao.com/activities/beach) - Developed beach, closer to town. A little expensive.
* [Cas Abao Beach](https://casabaobeach.com) - Similar to Porto Marie, also very nice.
* [Jan Thiel](https://www.janthielbeach.com/en/home/) - Towards the east part of the island, very nice too
* [Kokomo Beach and Restaurant](https://www.divecuracao.info/dive/curacao-diving-guide/kokomo-beach/) and Beach. Closer to town, and one of my favorites
* [Playa Lagun](https://exploringcuracao.com/playa-lagun-beach/) - Very rustic, small and pictoresque beach. A favorite for snorkling
* [Playa Porto Mari](https://www.playaportomari.com) - One of the favorites towards the west end of the island

## Food

Restaurants here are 1) expensive and 2) have slow service. Those are generalizations but it's good to set expectations. That way you won't be surprised.

Everything you eat here, almost, has to be imported, by plane or containership. Also it's a tourist destination which also add to the costs.

Overall the food will be familiar to you. You will have no trouble with the menus. Many of them are in Dutch, but almost all of them will have an English menu if you ask.

You will see standard "American" food, or "French" food. You will also see Indonesian (because Indonesia, like Curaçao used to be a colony of the Netherlands.) Also a lot of "Dutch" food.

### Restaurants

* [De Goeverneur](https://de-gouverneur.com) - The Dutch word for Governor. I am not really sure I spelled it right. But anyway, the big attraction here is the view. It has tables on a patio overlooking Punda and the harbor. It's very pretty. The food is also interesting and tasty.
* [Ginger Restuarant](https://gingercuracao.com) - a nice old Curacao neighborhood
* [Karakter restaurant](https://karaktercuracao.com) and beach and spa. Restaurant plus great _Spa The Eight_ is worthwhiile. with its Spa the eight experience is great ( we are going there on Wednesday)
* [Kome](https://www.komecuracao.com) - A favorite "nice" restaurant.
* [Landhuis Brakkeput Mei-Mei](https://brakkeputmeimei.com/en/) We also had a good experienc here.
* [Landhuis Daniel](https://landhuisdaniel.com) - Dutch Pancakes
* [Pirates Cove Restaurant and Beach](http://piratebaycuracao.com/index.html)
* [Restaurant Bij Blau](https://www.bijblauw.com)
* [Restaurant Dames](https://www.facebook.com/dedamescuracao/). Also in the "suburbs" of Saliña. Light, delicious sandwiches, coffee and local stuff
* [Restaurant Estys](https://estysbrasserie.com). New restaurant that is highly recommended. Also owned by a friend of a friend 🙂
* [Restaurant Heeren By The Sea](https://www.scubalodge.com/en/Restaurants/De-Heeren-at-Sea/). They have a really nice restaurant right on the beach. Not fancy but with a great atmosphere.
* [Restaurant Number Ten](https://numbertencuracao.com). Also in the "suburbs" of Mahaai. Created in an old residential mansion. Hip light food and coffee.
* [Restaurant Omundo](https://omundocuracao.com). In the "suburbs". A nice kind of hip restaurant recently under new management.

* [Soi95 Restaurant](https://soi95.com)


## Not as good as they sound

You might hear or read about these places but in my opinion they are not
worth the trip. Although I was surprised to hear recently of someone who loved
the Ostrich Farm, so, who knows!

* Zoo or Botanical Garden
* [Swimming With turtles](https://exploringcuracao.com/swimming-with-sea-turtles-in-curacao/) - Really not worth it.
* [Jaanchi](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1724323-d1046541-r16242388-Jaanchies_Restaurant-Sabana_Westpunt_Curacao.html)  (or Jan Kristian) restaurant
* [Ostrich Farm](https://curacaoostrichfarm.com/?lang=en)

## Web Sites and Resources

These are some excellent resources for knowing what's going on. 

* [K'Pasa](https://kpasa.com/curacao/) - This flier comes out weekly and you can find it everywhere. It is a pretty complete rundown of what's going on .
* [Curacao for 91 Days](https://curacao.for91days.com) - I found this site while googling around. It has lots of interesting ideas.
* [In Your Pocket Guide](https://www.inyourpocket.com/Curacao)- I found this site while googling around. It has lots of interesting ideas.
* [Museums of Curacao](https://museumsofcuracao.org/museums/) - A nicely done listing of all the museums and near-museums.
* [Adventure Tours Curacao](https://adventuretourscuracao.com) - Especially good for ATV tours.
* [Best Things to Do In Curacao](https://www.myglobalviewpoint.com/best-things-to-do-in-curacao/) - A pretty good summary which I generally agree with!


## Where to stay

Always a very personal decision. There are tons of hotels and inns on the
island. I've stayed in a few of them. So here's a very idiosyncratic listing:

* Royal Resort - A beautiful private resort with rental suites. It's not
really a hotel in that it has just a minor restaurant but it is a gret setting
with pools and beaches and fantastic setting.
* Avila - Kind of old timey hotel. Very popular with traditional.
* Trupial - Motel-like, in Mahaai, one of the residential neighborhood
* Renaissance - American-style large hotel, right in down town
