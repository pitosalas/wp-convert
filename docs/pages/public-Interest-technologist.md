>> I recently realized that there's a word for one of the things I do. It's
"Public-Interest Technologist". Modeled after the concept of Public-Interest
Law, I have and will continue to work on behalf of non-profits, charities, and
other public good organizations _pro-bono_ on anything within my area of
expertise. Ranging from simple coding, web site construction all the way to
technology selection, vetting of contractors, or strategy related questions.

>> If you are interested in my services for the public interest, please send
me an email and I will be glad to make time to find out if I can help.

>>> _I think of public-interest technologists as people who combine their
technological expertise with a public-interest focus, either by working on
tech policy, working on a tech project with a public benefit, or working as a
more traditional technologist for an organization with a public-interest
focus. Public-interest technology isn’t one thing; it’s many things. And not
everyone likes the term. Maybe it’s not the most accurate term for what
different people do, but it’s the best umbrella term that covers everyone._
