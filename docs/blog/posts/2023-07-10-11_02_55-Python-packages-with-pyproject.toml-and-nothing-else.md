[ Python packages with pyproject.toml and nothing
else](<https://til.simonwillison.net/python/pyproject>) –I've been using
setuptools and setup.py for my Python packages for a long time: I like that it
works without me having to think about installing and learning any additional
tools such as Flit or pip-tools or Poetry or Hatch .
