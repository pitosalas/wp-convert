Basically all dive sites are really good and pretty similar. There are dive operations all over the place. Some are more professional than others. </p> <p>For an operator that is on a beach (there are many) most will offer just shore dives. Some have a boat. The ones that operate from a hotel or developed area will often not have shore dives but will have one or two pretty big boats and they usually offer two dive packages, with a 1 hour or so stop at sea between them. They will give you water or juice or granola bars during the break. Getting in the water is easiest with a beach even if it is rocky. Next is off of one of the bigger boats although if the water is choppy you have to time your self to grab onto the ladder to get back on board which can be a little gnarly but very doable. THe crew on board is super helpful and qualified.I</p> <p>You can find any dive depth you want. The bottom falls off gradually and then fast. THere is a lot to see, corals and lots of fish etc. Sometimes there are man made objects like boats or cars etc to swim around. You can go by the name of the dive site realizing that they usually exaggerate what there is to see. Mushroom Forest is not really a forest for example.</p> <ul> <li>superior producer - my favorite - about 100\u2019 so on the deep side but really cool. Entry is a little gnarly but ok</li> <li>tugboat - very very shallow. FIne to bring snorkelers along. They will enjoy it as much.

Again there you can say what currency you want to pay in. Occasionally for bigger ticket items (like a car rental) they will tack on a 3-5% service fee to cover the credit card fees. </p> <p>Tipping is not as mandatory as in the USA. I tried to tip 10% for decent service in restaurants which I think is typical. Note that often the credit card machine does not offer a \"tip\" option.

It should include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Objective: In a few sentences indicate the goal or overall objective of the project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Readings: This is the \"independent study\" part. Books, papers, chapters, etc are all appropriate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Description: What is the study? What will you actually \"do\"? Be realistic and not overly ambitious.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deliverables: one ore more demonstration, paper, report, video. All delivery should be collected in a single GitHub repository which normally will be public.</p> </li> <li> <p>Schedule with at least two milestones: midterm (week 7) and final (week 13). For each milestone indicate what you expect to have done.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software and/or hardware required. This is especially relevant for Robotics projects but may apply elsewhere.</p> </li> <li> <p>You and why you think you can do this: Something about your own background, skills, courses, and experiences which you bring to the Independent Study and will serve to give credibility to your proposal</p> </li> <li> <p>Discussion: Additional discussion of the project, including, for example, relevant investigation needed ahead of time, papers or literature, tools required, need for funds if any, etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Types - There are several course numbers corresponding to independent studies. As of now, CS98a is an undergraduate independent study. CS99a is the first semester of a Senior Honors Thesis. Cosi210a is for graduate students. Depending on your status you will pick a different course.</p> <p>One or multiple students - Generally independent studies are done by a single student but multiple students are possible when the scope of the project requires it.</p> <p>Meetings - We will have weekly meetings during the semester. Once you are well on your way we might move to a meeting every other week.</p> <p>Rapid iterations and demos - It is important to try to get to demonstrable preliminary results as quickly as possible. I have found that this discipline helps keep an independent study on track and allows us to detect early that a pivot is required.</p> <p>Deliverables - At the end of the term there will be a deliverable of some kind. We will work out the details, but in general I like the deliverables in the form of a GitHub repository. It could include any models, drawings, images, documents, code, and any other artifacts. Associated with the repository is a multi-page report written as showcase of the results of the project, describe the process, describing future work, including help for someone who would like to continue the project. I would like the repo to be public and open source.</p> <p>Grading - We will agree on assessment criteria at the start of the project. Generally I ask you to propose how you would like to be assessed and use that as a starting point. There will be a midterm grade which will count for 1/4 of the final grade, and then a end-term grade which will count for 3/4 of the grade.</p> <p>Independent Study</p>"},{"location":"pages/Keeping-Up/","title":"Keeping Up","text":"<p>I get this question fairly often from students who have just completed their first or second semester programming course at Brandeis and would like to continue on their own.

You might call it one of the legacy conferences (\u2026 to contrast it with the new cool conferences such as the Emerging Technology Forum and BloggerCon.)</p> <p>If you are interested in what new products are coming out of the mainstream computer industry, Demo is great. Chris Shipley who is the MC/Executive Producer, selects about 60 products from all corners of the industry representing the latest greatest. The selection criteria, as I understand them, require the products to be new (using a semi-flexible definition of \"new\") So it could be a brand new product from a brand new company, or a revolutionary new twist or generation of an existing product. But these are all hard-core-we-intend-to-make-a-lot-of-money kinds of deals, vs. the 'other kind' of product.</p> <p>Products that are especially interesting (to Chris) are put onto a break- neck, 7 minute per demo, one and a half day schedule of stage presentations. They are organized, more or less, by themes with Chris herself providing commentary and context setting as the conference progresses. It's an excellent format and a great way to see a lot and quickly.</p> <p>In addition to the stage demos, there are 'booths' where you can actually see and touch the product, and importantly, speak to the actual people who invented or built the product, and actually get in depth with them about the products that really intrigue you.</p> <p>Anyway, I took notes during the meetings and I thought, since I had already done the writing for my own benefit, I'd share them here for yours.</p>"},{"location":"2004/02/25/search-innovations-demo-2004-series/","title":"Search Innovations (Demo 2004 Series","text":"<p>Link: Search Innovations (Demo 2004 Series: \"\"</p> <p>Search Innovations (Demo 2004 Series - 2) - Two interesting Seach products were showcased: Grokker 2 from Groxis and p-Zoom from Big On The Net.

Luckily the latest Beta of FeedDemon does support Atom and so I can read Paul's blog right along all my other favorites.</p> <p>This is just another in the continuing format, API, or protocol conflicts which arise constantly in the our business. It's a good kind of conflict because it raises important issues and allows things to evolve to a better place.</p> <p>Remember VIM and MAPI? That battle shook the very foundations of the software industry at the time. (VIM stood for \"Vendor Independent Messaging\" but the running joke was that it really stood for \"Vendors Ignoring Microsoft\", led by Lotus. Remember Lotus \ud83d\ude09 And more recently, how about SHTTP vs. HTTPS? HTTPS eventually became SSL which of course is all anyone remembers.</p> <p>My point is that as our products and visions and customers and platforms move forward, there is a constant tension between evolution and compatibility. It's clear that this is a good thing in the end, although a whole lot of glass is broken along the way. The one thing I know for sure is that it's way too early to stop the evolution right now.</p>"},{"location":"2004/03/01/comparing-this-years-demo-to/","title":"Comparing this years Demo to","text":"<p>Link: Comparing this years Demo to: \"\"</p> <p>Comparing this years Demo to previous years (Demo 2004 Series - 7A)  As I've been writing these little Demo reports from my notes, I realized  that as I have been going to Demo for years (in fact I think I've been to almost all of them) I had perhaps an interesting perspective, and this little thoughtlet bubbled in my brain:</p> <p>In the last few years, the burst bubble seemed to impact Demo by showing down to earth, obvious ROI products and services.

Why? Here are some things to think about:</p> <p>From my eRoom and Collaboration days, I've been very aware of the challenges to achieving adoption. My view is that the challenge exists whenever the adoption of a new application or system requires some degree of coordination between a set of users. Email is by far the greatest example of an application of computers which has very successfully overcome that barrier. I want to learn from that.</p> <p>Second reason: I've observed that the tools we use to work with email (the general striucture email applications, email protocols, email use models) basically were laid down in the 1970's. And yet, in the past 30 years (!) email's role in society has totally changed, the volume of email has totally changed, the numbers of users have totally changed, the purposes of use have totally changed. It feels like we are due for a major re-think of the model.</p> <p>Would it be the merging of Instant Messaging with Email? Might it be the merging of collaboration tools with Email. Might it be some fundamental move away from the Inbox/Outbox/Folders/Compose/Forward/Reply model to something perhaps more appropriate to the new world of email?</p> <p>Anyway, back to Demo 2004. There were some interesting email \"related\" applications launched at Demo.</p> <p>Bloomba Email Client : Bloomba 2.0 is, believe it or not, an Outlook replacement that is worth a look. They are literally and knowingly going head to head with Microsoft. They have a heavy emphasis on searching within the email, which as you know, I think is super important and overlooked. They've done a very nice job with the application, and as I say, worth a look.</p> <p>MailBlocks Web Based Email client: This is a very interesting integration of email, calendar and contact information. I believe that there is also fancy spam filtering technology. But the neatest (and useful to me) feature is the automatic parsing of emails to locate contact info changes and meeting information and proposing them to you as calendar and address book updates. While there are multiple web based mail clients, this one has a neat angle. Very nice. If you are interested in this web based mail client, you should also check out OddPost, which is interesting because it's a tour-de-force DHTML application that actually creates a real GUI Outlook Express like experience, all with just a browser, and no downloads.</p>"},{"location":"2004/03/01/scoble-on-search-robert-scoble/","title":"Scoble on Search.

I've been using several neat offshore development options in my work on Blog Bridge, a new kind of Blog Reader that I've been working on (very) part time. You can read all about it: here.</p> <p>There's a developer in Russia , a designer in China , a programmer in Norway and one in California (ok, not really offshore.) I don't want to exagerate, each of these folks has done one project for me, mostly pretty small. It's been an experiment for me to see how this works and how effective it could be. So far so good.</p> <p>The designer in China redesigned the www.blogbridge.com web site. You can take a look. It was very reasonably priced and the work was professional. Nothing extremelyy fancy, but clearly fancier than I have the skills to do. The three developers did various pieces of Java code, installation script and even a windows .dll. So, real code: again very reasonably priced.</p> <p>Open Source. As you may or may not know, Blog Bridge is Open Source. I've had several people say, _it 's open source and your paying someone to work on it? _At first this may sound counter intuitive, but really it's not at all. After all, if I personally work on Open Source stuff, I may not be paying cash, but I am certainly paying with my time. It's just that I choose to make the fruits of my labor freely available to anyone who wants it. I see no contradiction.</p> <p>How the heck does a small shop like mine get offshore development going? This is actually quite cool. It turns out that there are several online 'markets' where I can post a functional spec or project description and receive quotes from contractors who want to take on the project.</p> <p>I have been extremely impressed with the quality of people that bid. How do I find out? Well there's always a bit of back and forth on email while you are considering a bid proposal. By the questions that they ask as well as the answers they give to your questions, it's usually pretty clear who's good and who is not.</p> <p>My favorites of these markets are Rent-a- Coder for development and Elance for design. I've used both to good success.

I remember how shell shocked we were in the U.S. two months after 9/11.</p> <p>Well, here's the surprising thing. There was almost no noticable security presence or sense of mourning, danger, worry. At the airports there was no more than the usual security presence. At the railstations there was nothing noticable.

It's open source also because of the license that you'll see in each source file, the so-called \"Lesser GPL.\" I would like to say that I chose that one after long and careful thought, but the truth is that I picked it more or less randomly because another project that I am contributing to was using it.</p> <p>Now that BlogBridge is going to get some more visibility, the question is, what rights exactly do I want to give away and which ones do I want to keep for myself?</p> <p>My current answers are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>I want it to be legitimately 'Open Source'</p> </li> <li> <p>I want anyone to be able to look at the source code and play with it, for personal purposes and limited commercial purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p>I want to reserve to myself the right to license or sell BlogBridge to a commercial entity for commercial purposes.</p> </li> <li> <p>I want to reserve to myself the rights of invention and origination and patent.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Ok, let's refine that.</p> <p>What are commercial purposes and what are limited commercial purposes?

This argument rests on the premise that the world is a lot more than personal computers, and very importantly includes mobile devices like cell phones and PDAs. In trying to put this in to numbers, they seem to try to take credit in counting the number of network elements of all kinds of things which I don\u2019t think of as Java (RF-ID tags are not really Java are they? Is eBay Java? I don\u2019t think of ring tones as Java.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Take Away 2: There\u2019s a renewed focus on the desktop. With this new focus, I think Sun is admitting that in the past Java was not known as suitable for desktop apps. And of course this point contradicts the preceding one to some extent. Java Studio Creator is their VB killer. But the demo was confusing because it looked more like a drag and drop web based development tool. The business that this is for non-programmers is not especially believable, but this is not different from MSFT</p> </li> <li> <p>Take Away 3: Sun talks a lot about monetizing Java , about the size of the opportunity for developers. Sun claims that the Java economy is $100B. Not sure how they get to that number My questions is how will Sun itself make money here? I asked some people, and the answer I got was \u201cSell hardware, sell Java cards.\u201d Somehow I am not persuaded.

As I said, a long time ago \ud83d\ude42</p> <p>Anyway, for years I've been a PC guy, but still with a warm spot in my heart for Mac. Recently we got an iBook in our family and so I had a chance to reaquaint myself with how the world had changed.</p> <p>After hearing disparaging remarks from Mac folks about Windows XP lack of usability and elegance I was all set to be blown away by OSX. Here some first impressions.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Yes indeed, OSX is beautiful to look at. It wows you with some nifty and novel animations. The level of design, colors, icons, etc. is all really enjoyable to look at.</p> </li> <li> <p>OSX has a little Unix heart beating inside it. This means it's nirvana for Unix folks. But to the average joe it also means something: stability. It has yet to crash on me.</p> </li> <li> <p>I can't believe that it still has only a single button mouse. And it's funny because you can see how OSX gradually is inching towards giving in on this little bit of obsolete religion. If you plug a 2 button mouse into the USB port, it works like a charm. And the scroll wheel works. And some applications even put up a context menu. But because Mac is conflicted about this, this is not nearly consistent and pervasive enough.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gluing the menu bar to the top of the screen an antiquated holdover from when screens were tiny and there was no multi-tasking (even the term multi-tasking sounds quaint given that everyone does it.) The result is that it's often not obvious what application you are in.</p> </li> <li> <p>And while the dialog boxes are pretty, they are not necessarily well designed. One trivial example: if you are setting up your airport, and you have enabled security (like everyone does) then it is not explained anywhere that you must precede the hex password with a dollar sign to get it to work. Another trivial one: in more than one place I was 4 steps down a 'wizard' when I decided to quit out of it, except there was no Cancel button. I had to 'back-back-back' to get back to the start.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Anyway there you have it. I think with this experience I would debate the Mac user's claim that Mac is inherently easier to use than WInXP. First of all, it's more similar than different and second of all, it's not all good.</p>"},{"location":"2004/07/23/will-wikis-rule-the-world/","title":"Will Wikis Rule the World?","text":"<p>Link: Will Wikis Rule the World?: \"\"</p> <p>I was recently asked by a VC friend of mine what I thought of a certain Wiki product.

He asked me, \"Have you kept track of what 's going on in Wiki-land, and what do you think?\"</p> <p>Here's my answer :</p> <p>Yes, I have very much kept track of the wiki stuff. After doing eRoom, which is still among the best collab systems out there in my (humble) opinion, I very much believe that there's a whole next generation of collaboration that is needed. I say this because eRoom and others fall really short when it comes to get mass adoption. Wiki's might point in that direction.</p> <p>That said, I think Wikis today are abominable. They have a few breakthrough ideas, certainly, but other than that they are IMHO very hard to use and will in their current form be adopted by few. Also in my opinion, in terms of enterprise adoption, they will suffer the same challenges that eRoom and all the others do: customers don't really experience enough pain collaborating as they do today over email and IM. They are and will continue to be hard pressed to spend real money on solving the 'collaboration' problem.</p> <p>The more likely strategy , still, is one of verticalization : understanding specific use scenarios, building specialized flavors of collaboration stuff, and marrying this with the right marketing strategy and sales approach.</p>"},{"location":"2004/07/24/announcing-the-blogbridge-service-/","title":"Announcing\u2026 The BlogBridge Service ;-)","text":"<p>Link: Announcing\u2026 The BlogBridge Service ;-): \"\"</p> <p></p> <p>Here's a sneak preview of something a little bit different.

I wrote about this question a few months ago, and now, having consulted with people who know, here's an update.</p> <p>First of all, start with the goals.</p> <ul> <li>BlogBridge should be available, in source code form and executable form to everyone who wants to look at it and use it. It should be a bona fida open source project. Reasoning : We will be able to recruit others to help us build it; It is a significant differentiator among the other blog readers out there; And we can legitimately use services such as Source Forge to manage the project and its source code.</li> <li>If a commercial entity wants to use the code to build a commercial business, we would like them to have to come to us for permission. Reasoning : Obviously, we aren't making any money on this; if someone else wants to, it would be nice if we were involved.</li> </ul> <p>As it turns out, this is not an unusual set of objectives, and it is pretty straightforward to achieve.</p> <p>As of BlogBridge 0.5.4, the product will be licensed under the GPL (rather than the LGPL which is what we had before.)</p> <p>The effect of this is that the first objective above is fully achieved implicitly. The second objective is achieved, indirectly:</p> <p>Because the GPL is quite strict in its requirements of releasing any modifications, enhancements, etc also under the GPL, it makes the source code as it stands unsuitable for a commercial purpose. The obligations attached to modifying the source would really discourage anyone from building a business around it.</p> <p>(You might wonder, once you've released something as Open Source, can you decide to change the license? Isn't that prohibited? It turns out that it's perfectly alright.)</p> <p>The code as it stands therefore is incompatible with a commercial project. If we decide that we want to embark on, or give someone else the ability to embark on a commercial project, what do we do?</p> <p>We release a copy of the source code under a different, commerical license. This copy forms the basis of the commerical project. It's called \"dual licensing \" and it's a well understood and accepted model.</p>"},{"location":"2004/08/05/can-you-change-the-license/","title":"Can you change the license of an Open Source product?","text":"<p>Link: Can you change the license of an Open Source product?: \"\"</p> <p>This puzzled me. Once we released the BlogBridge source code under the LGPL, it was out in the open, and published to the world. Had we forfeited the right to change the license? The answer depends on who owns and holds the Copyright to the code.</p> <p>As it is, all the code was either personally written by me (90%) or written by others who have agreed to transfer ownership to me. In other words,I hold a clear copyright to all the code, and that is the key. This makes it legitimate and legal to reissue the same source code under a new license.</p> <p>What existed before (i.e. everything up to 0.5.3) under LGPL will not cease to exist or be available under the LGPL, but, all continuing work, enhancements and so on will be governed by the GPL and that's what counts.</p> <p>So the key requirement is that, no matter what the open source license is, do you have clear ownership and if you do, you can re-release it under a different license.

If you don't have a burning curiosity, trust me, it will put you to sleep \ud83d\ude42</p> <p>The basic idea for the BlogStarz! mechanism is simple but the UI at this point is still confusing practically everyone. I will explain it here and describe changes we are planning.</p> <p>The idea is that the BlogStarz! are generated by BlogBridge and are meant to be a summary rating that ought to match how interesting this particular blog would be to the user, based on several factors.</p> <p>Currently 4 factors are implemented: your personal rating (thumbs up/down); how 'authorotative' this blog is (based on Technorati rating); how 'active' the blog is; and how many of your keywords hit in the blog. If you look in BlogBridge/Preferences/BlogStarz you'll see 4 sliders that allow you to customize the weight you'd like to put to each of those factors towards the overall one to 5 star rating.</p> <p>Now, more on each of the factors. Thumbs Up/Down is today implemented inconsistently. While the menu says thumbs up and down, the corresponding indicator is the little icon in the top right of the blog's entry in the Channels pane. Clicking on it you can see that it goes through 3 states: grey box (for neutral), heart (for positive) and bomb (for negative.) Obviously these are temporary icons. In the future this will change to a 4 state icon in the shape of a thumb pointing up. It will go like this: greyed out, thumbs up, two thumbs up and three thumbs up. It will have the same effect - allowing you to give your own personal rating on the blog.</p> <p>We can determine how authoritative a certain blog is via the Technorati service. For now, you have to get a free Technorati key from them by going to www.technorati.com and requesting an API key. And then in BlogBridge, under Preferences/Advanced you can enter the key (cut/paste but be careful of a trailing space which will throw it off.) Once you do that, BlogBridge will, in the background, ask Technorati how many inbound blog links there are in a certain blog, and use that number as an indication of how authoritative the blog is.</p> <p>Activity of a blog is simply how many posts have been added since you started subscribing to it, divided by time. So a rough average of number of posts per day.</p> <p>In the BlogBridge/Preferences/Highlights tab (should be called Keywords tab) you can enter a list of words and phrases which are important to you. BlogBridge will use those in many ways. It will highlight those words wherever it sees them. It will also count them and rate a blog higher if there are a lot of hits.</p> <p>You can see that this is a pretty elaborate, and overly configurable scheme. That's because we are still trying to learn which of these factors (or others) are the best predictor of the subjective \"how interesting will you find this blog\" question, which the Starz are meant to convey.</p>"},{"location":"2004/10/21/best-red-sox-headline/","title":"Best Red Sox Headline","text":"<p>Link: Best Red Sox Headline: \"\"</p> <p>Isn 't it sweet!

I also heard him present in a big hall. If you are a Wiki fan then you know that Ward is the one who invented the concept.</p> <p>What seems to be a little less well known is how the idea evolved, where it came from. I am sure it's written up somewhere. but I thought I'd write down my own idiosynchratic understanding of the story.</p> <p>Ward was involved in the early days of the Design Patterns movement, which seems to have it's own roots in the OOPSLA conference. So here's the story.</p> <p>At some gathering it was noted that there ought to be a central repository of all the patterns that had been invented to date and a way for new ones to be added.</p> <p>Ward kindly voluteered to build and maintain this repository. This was in the early days of the Web, and it seemed like the logical medium to do this in. So Ward set out to create a web site to be the repository. It still exists!</p> <p>The problem was that no one really knew HTML at the time. So they would send Ward emails with ideas for Patterns to be added to the repository and Ward would then be editing those emails into HTML and then posting the pages. This didn 't scale too well.</p> <p>Because the agreed upon form of a Pattern description was fairly consistent, Ward decided to write a script to process the text he received automatically into HTML. In fact he added some helpful formalisms like a '\" for a bullet and so on. He asked people to follow this to make his life of adding the new pages to the repository easier. See where this is headed*?</p> <p>Ward was able to run his script and process the properly formatted Pattern descriptions and turn them into HTML pages. This saved a lot of time maintaining the web site with all the patterns.</p> <p>It occurred to Ward that he could automate this even further if he had a page on his site where someone could submit their nicely formatted text. The site would then automatically run the script, generate the html and store it in the right place.  And so proto-wiki was born. Of course this Wiki-markup is only one of the three (IMHO) seminal features of Wikis. The other two are: the total lack of access control and the ability to refer to something before it exists.More on those later. </p> <p>So that's the story, as I heard it.

Why? Because I kind of suspect that one of the early values of something like BlogBridge to people outside the hard-core blog fanatics (I am one) will be as an alternative way to email to receive notifications (like from UPS), mailing list updates (like from yahoo.groups) , and online web site content updates (like NYT.) These are or will soon be using RSS and possibly are of more direct benefit to someone who is not signed up to the blog phenomenon.</p> <p>Why do I call BlogBridge 'next gen'? The focus of the app is to actively help the user deal with information overload. In features that are working now or are planned for the first release, BlogBridge does things like:</p> <p>1) allow the user to indicate which are their favorite feeds (via a Tivo like thumbs up feature.) This information is used to generate a composite 1-5 star rating.</p> <p>2) takes advantage of services like Technorati to figure out how 'authoratitive' a certain feed is (based on the number of inlinks) and factors that into the 1-5 star rating</p> <p>3) Lets the user easily temporarily filter out or permanently unsubscribe from feeds which fall below a certain star rating</p> <p>4) Analyzes the feeds the user is looking at, and locates links to new feeds that the user didn't know about and 'suggests' them if they are highly rated.</p> <p>5) The user can set up a set of 'keywords' which are then highlighted in the articles, as well as summarized at a feed level so you can easily find those feeds which are talking about stuff you are interested in.</p> <p>6) A user's thumbs-up rating can be uploaded to a companion BlogBridge Service. Eventually this will form the basis of a collaborative filtering capability.</p> <p>7) Allows a user to share their particular set of favorite blogs with other users. This will allow me for example to subscribe to a set of blogs that mimic what Danny Ayers is following on the subject of RSS.</p> <p>And there are other ideas floating around. The central theme is dealing with information overload and saving time for the user who is interested in following a hundred or more feeds.</p> <p>As an aside, this is an open source project. It is a client side app (other than the service which of course is a server side.) And it is cross platform, written in Java, and runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (as well as others I am sure, I just haven't tested them.)</p> <p>I hope this is useful and of course would love to be included in your book.

You can get it here.  The way we work it is that if after a week or so of use there are no show stopped bugs, we will promote the Alpha to a Beta. The general release model is described here.</p> <p>This new version has a ton of new feature stuff, plus major stability and performance improvements. I dare say, we are getting close to having a Release 1.0 product. Here are some highlights:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The BlogBridge Service gets a major new capability, which is RSS Discovery Services. The change to the user experience is minimal but I would say pretty significant. When you want to add a Feed, you don't need to hunt for the RSS Feed URL, which our non-technical users won't even understand. You just enter the URL for the Blog itself, that is, the one you read with a Web Browser, and BlogBridge will attempt to 'discover' the RSS Feed. Behind the scenes it spawns a process to talk to the BlogBridge Service to resolve it. Try it, it's pretty cool!</p> </li> <li> <p>The second major new capability is the Feed Discovery Service. In it's initial form, there is a new command on the Feed Menu: \"Discover new Feeds\". Again working behind the scenes with the service, BlogBridge will analyze all the articles in a certain Feed, to see whether any of them point to Blogs that you don't know yet. If so, they are highlighted right in the article (let's say in Red.) The user can right click on the link and in one step add that new Feed to their subscription list.</p> </li> <li> <p>Among the smaller changes are, much better (although not yet perfect) support of Mac OSX, a minor change to the menu structure and terminology based on customer feedback, and numerous bug fixes and performance improvements.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Here is a link to the announcement email we sent to our users.

I should have labeled them Applogogy #1 and #2. I appologize.]</p> <p>Anyway, if you've followed SOAP and the related and simpler standard known as XML-RPC you will have noticed a big difference, particularly in the degree of complexity in each scheme. And by the way, SOAP has spawned a whole series of related formats or standards, one more complicated than the one before it.</p> <p>Anyway, Adam Bosworth, closely connected to the origins of SOAP, in this speech gives an empassioned plea for what we know as the \"KISS\" principle. Where I went to school, KISS stood for \"Keep it Simple Stupid\" (yes, I didn't get out much \ud83d\ude42 but Adam Bosworth uses to mean Keep it Simple and Sloppy.</p> <p>This argument about how simple is too simple is an important (and not new) one in our field. Adam Bosworth's article is a good piece because it collects together many of the traditional points as well as clever phrases which are used in this debate which we see in our field in many different guises, and it makes you think.</p> <p>I don't have the answer or really a clear opinion.

But on the other hand, I have seen plenty of examples of totally overengineered systems and architectures to know that unnecessary complexity is definitely a disease that inflicts us in this field.</p> <p>So I am not ready to say one way or the other that simpler is always better, or that one approach (for example SOAP) is clearly inferior to another one (for example XML-RPC.)

Improv set out \"to fix all this\". It was an auditors dream. It provided rarified heights of abstraction, formalisms for rows and columns, and in short was truly comprehensible. It failed utterly , not because it failed in its ambitions but because it succeeded._</p> <p>I happen to know a little bit about this \ud83d\ude42 I was the guy , for better or worse, who came up with the idea for Improv and got it built and shipped at Lotus.</p> <p>Let me start by saying I have neither a PhD nor an MBA (and proud of it!) And I am almost positive there was not a single one of those on the Improv team. But other than that, Adam makes I think an important and accurate observation.</p> <p>This is so many years ago now so I don't think about it much anymore. But at one point I was often asked and thought about what happened with Improv and why it failed. And while I had more complicated answers at the time, I have to say that there is a lot to what Adam says.</p> <p>It's easy to get all philosophical about what makes a spreadsheet a spreadsheet, what it's core essence is. And I have. It's hard to argue that one of the keys is the maleability of the spreadsheet as a medium. The fact that a spreadsheet can grow organically, be modified and grown in a kind of an Improvisational manner. But when spreadsheets get complicated they get messy and error-prone and this is what Improv set out to address.</p> <p>In the end it didn't go anywhere, probably because in setting out to improve on spreadsheets, Improv lost the essence of a spreadsheet and in doing so lost the market.</p> <p>Innovators Dilemma</p> <p>There is an interesting Innovators Dilemma kind of perspective here, referring to the now-classic book \"The Innovators Dilemma\" by Clayton M. Christensen. To summarize one of the key theses of the book extremely briefly:</p> <ol> <li> <p>that a new technology might initially have a fatal flaw which makes it unsuitable for the purpose it was intended for. (For example, Electric cars don't have the range or speed to meet the needs of today's drivers.)</p> </li> <li> <p>An established maker of cars (e.g. Ford) has a strong disincentive to invest in Electric cars because it doesn't meet the need of it's existing customer base.</p> </li> <li> <p>An upstart competitor could identify a different market where the apparent flaws (speed and range) are actually 'features' not 'bugs' (for example a car specifically made for very young drivers) and use that market as a spring board to be able to perfect the technology.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eventually the upstart has years of experience with the new technology (the batteries and drive train) and improves it to the point where it actually does meet the need of mainstream customers, while the established player has been ignoring things and gets unseated.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I am not sure it applies, but one could argue a parallel here with Improv. In particular this would lead you to the conclusion that the key strategy mistake was to try to market Improv to the existing spreadsheet market. Instead, if the product were marketed to a segment where the more structured model was a 'feature' not a 'bug' would have given Lotus the time to learn and improve and refine the model to a point where it would have satisfied the larger market as well.</p> <p>Who knows.

I hope it is not inconsistent to feel that way, and yet agree that for a variety of reason it was not successful, as a product.</p> <p>The concept of an alternative (not replacement) for a spreadsheet for real financial modeling is, I think, quite sound. (Yes, I can do page layout in Microsoft Word, but if that's my purpose, PageMaker is better. You could make an analogous point about PowerPoint and PhotoShop.)</p> <p>By the same token , if what one is building a real financial model (i.e. a business plan or an integrated set of financial statements) then a product like Improv would be far superior. I say like Improv, because that was over 10 years ago, and it certainly had room for improvement at the time.</p> <p>I received an email from Peter Murray, CTO of a company called Quantrix. They have created a new application called Quantrix Modeler in the spirit of Improv, which has continued to improve and http://www.quantrix.com/r-section-2.phpthe model. Here is what Peter said of my posting [slightly edited for length]:  </p> <p>Dear Pito,</p> <p>I was interested to read your response to Adam Bosworth's talk @ ICSOC'04.</p> <p>The Improv model is not \"ancient history\" yet! At Quantrix, we believe there is significant value in the Improv inspired approach to building complex models - and our customers are proving that out. There is no question that the free-form two-dimensional-grid based approach is useful in many cases. However, as soon as the calculation begins to get complex or the model is utilized through time in many iterations, our customers find that Quantrix is a more powerful tool.</p> <p>Our theory on the reasons for the demise of Improv follow more the line of thinking in your final paragraph, rather than the idea that the product is somehow inherently flawed:</p> <p>1) Lotus was positioning Improv as a spreadsheet replacement, rather than a specialized tool to better perform an important subset of tasks currently performed with a spreadsheet.</p> <p>2) Lotus was in the throes of a heroic battle for survival against Microsoft's Excel - causing undue pressure on the company to make its product portfolio clean and understandable, and to organize all resources behind the flagship product. Introducing new technology costs in a scenario such as that.</p> <p>Quantrix is employing a patient approach which identifies niches where the pain on traditional tools is great and the relief from a more scalable, transparent solution is palpable. As we progress, we are listening to users and building in new / better functionality - and thus making the product more attractive to a larger audience. In fact, we have folks from all kinds of disciplines who have sought out an alternative solution to the traditional spreadsheet - financial planning / budgeting professionals, equity analysts, business consultants as well as engineers, scientists and policy researchers. We even have customers working on genome analysis with Quantrix.</p> <p>So, rather than ancient history, we prefer to think that - in this case - \"what's old is new again\".</p> <p>[\u2026]</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>pete</p> <p>And just to close the loop, here is what I responded: </p> <p>Overall, I agree with that analysis.</p> <p>Of course, I would hope that the Improv model wasn't ancient history! I was referring to the particulars of my experience at Lotus. I can be critical of people who live in the past and relive long past experiences so I am always careful of that myself. That is a totally closed chapter for me and I wouldn't have even thought of it until I read Adam's story. My feeling was that at a very high level he was hitting the nail on the head.</p> <p>The notion of something being \"inherently fatally flawed\" seems relative to me when applied to a product. For example, if I tell you I have designed a great new televeision but I don't include a screen, well it's fatally flawed.

In my own small way I am hoping to wake up someone at Sun to see the importance of this little bit of technology to their grand Java strategy.</p> <p>In my interview with ClientJava I again made some pointed comments about Java Web Start, and in the comment thread some annonymous person (coward) asked me to elaborate. Here is what I said.</p> <p>\"Why has WebStart been such a disappointment? I've written about this in my blog, here and here. Basically, the promise of WebStart is great: a cross platform way to deploy, install and update Java based desktop apps. The disappointment is that it comes close to working but then fails in so many different ways. It's a tease. </p> <ul> <li> <p>There is no reliable cross platform way to check and then install a java environment. And then to add insult to injury, there's no user friendly URL to send users to that does it for them. Try looking at www.java.com. It's so sad. Lots of useless and confusing marketing and a little link in the corner to install Java.</p> </li> <li> <p>Java Web Start is the very first experience my users get with BlogBridge. And it is the #1 cause for problems. I would say about 10% attempts don't work. People will only give an app like BlogBridge one chance so those are all lost sales. If you are really technical, you might be able to fight your way through and figure out how to install the jre or re-install it because it was corrupted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Even when it works it does absurd things like telling the user that installation is strongly discouraged if there is no digital signature. This might sound like it makes sense but if you really think about it, a digital signature from BlogBridge Inc. would add no confidence whatsoever to the user that bad things wouldn't happen. All I need is $300 for a certificate and a postal address.</p> </li> </ul> <p>And there are lots more reasons. The thing that is hard to understand is why Sun doesn't see that if you want Java to take hold on the desktop, solving this problem, really solving it, is more important than probably any of the improvements in 1.5. And the only way to solve it is to have hard-core experts in each platform (Windows in all its flavors, Mac in all its flavors, Unix in all its flavors) building the solution. Becuase a working solution will be very difficult to build. But it is the keys to the kingdom IMHO. \"</p>"},{"location":"2004/12/12/im-in-good-company/","title":"I\u2019m in good company","text":"<p>Link: I\u2019m in good company: \"\"</p> <p>A week or so ago I posted an amusing picture, supposedly from Popular Mechanics.

First things first: GMail is now my primary email provider. Yes, you heard that right. It's free, does a great job with spam and I can continue to use Outlook. Life is good.</p> <p>First of all, what is GMail (for those of you who have been living under a rock!) GMail is Google's free, web based, email service. Its major claim to fame, at least initially, was the 1 Gig of free Mail storage they provide. Kind of amazing isn't it? When it first came out, that got all the attention. In fact it seems to have forced Hotmail and Yahoo mail to increase the amount of free storage they provide. I don't believe that they are up to 1 Gig though.</p> <p>But that's not what attracted me. My issue was spam. I was running on a private mail server which didn't have a spam filter. Instead, I ran Matador's Mail Front, which is a very effective client solution. But what you really want is a server side solution. In my case, the reason was that I also download email to my Treo phone, directly from the server, and hence, no spam filter: phone is flooded with junk mail.</p> <p>So as an experiment, I redirected all my email to my GMail account, and then used GMail's new free POP service, to pull that email into Outlook as well as into the phone. Sweet!</p> <p>GMail, with no training, was catching spam with what feels like 99% accuracy. Other than that, my Outlook experience is unchanged, and my Treo phone based email is much much better (no spam.)I recommend it.</p> <p>Interesting questions to ponder: How can they afford to give me all this service for free? What might their long term stragegy be? Whats the story with the GMail invites and how do you get one?</p>"},{"location":"2004/12/14/how-seinfeld-as-shaped-popular/","title":"How Seinfeld as shaped popular culture","text":"<p>Link: How Seinfeld as shaped popular culture: \"\"</p> <p>In this morning's Blog reading, I saw two references to Seinfeld episodes, in each case the reference was just thrown into a headline without further comment.

This key characteristic has been crucial to the success of blogging and the eventual success of Podcasting and video blogging, in this sense.</p> <p>By making 'publishing' (in the most general sense of the word) available to anyone, this technology is exactly what has lowered the barriers and allowed all kinds of people with something to say actually be able to say it and publish it.</p> <p>Let me elaborate. Publishing in the most general sense includes publishing of written content (newspapers, journals, magazines and books become blogs), but also audio content (radio shows become podcasts) and video content (tv programming become video blogs.)</p> <p>The technology is key in that development, on three fronts:</p> <ol> <li> <p>ease of use (allowing a anyone to write and article or produce a radio show)</p> </li> <li> <p>distribution (allowing this stuff to be consumed by anyone, instantly, around the globe)</p> </li> <li> <p>And ease of discovery (allowing someone who is interested to locate this content.)</p> </li> </ol> <p>With that ease, the theory goes, and the practice shows , an amazing multiitude of people suddenly decide that they have something to say to the other multitude of people who decide they want to follow what is being said.

I listened to a wonderful Podcast with Georges Harik all about GMail and some of the thinking about it. If you are interested in GMail, it's a worthwhile listen. I noticed that Georges kept referring to GMail as providing great emailand communications capabilities. An interesting and fine distinction to be stressing, although the interviewer never referred to it. Another interesting strategic point that was covered was the question of providing free POP and SMTP, which is certainly counterintuitive if you believe that GMail is being made to make money, and the only way they make money is via ads. For example, the way I am using GMail, through Outlook, I never see the ads. Something that was said also made me think about GMail as more than a consumer service. Georges seemed to focus totally on consumers, but at various points left me thinking about what was not said\u2026 Here are some speculations about Google's strategic intent with GMail:</p> <ul> <li> <p>I doubt that they will decide to start charging for the 1Gig of storage. That would be too close to being 'Evil'</p> </li> <li> <p>What if the longer term plan is to create a for-pay commercial offering. Going to global corporations like General Electric or Shell and offering to take over their email infrastructure? They could offer value added services for security, auditing, document retention, and many others. It would be worth a lot of dough to those companies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why the focus on 'communications' in the interview ? It seems to imply a distinct focus beyond simple email. Google might be positioning itself to get into other media. How about getting into IM or VOIP? How about aquiring Skype?</p> </li> <li> <p>For the first time Google is building some lock-in. By being the store for all their users email they make it much more difficult for people to take their business elsewhere. Without that there is no loyalty and the next hot search engine could lure us away.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Of course the truth may be more prosaic - It might be that this is a simple advertising revenue play - which might have **astronomical](http://mobile.gigaom.com/2006/08/31/americas-most-unwired- cities/) potential.</p>"},{"location":"2004/12/24/is-sarah-mclachlan-is-video/","title":"Is Sarah McLachlan is Video Podcasting?","text":"<p>Link: Is Sarah McLachlan is Video Podcasting?: \"\"</p> <p> On her site, World On Fire, Sarah McLachlan has an interesting video, which reminded me what Video podcasting or Video blogging can become.  Picking up on a theme of mine from a few days ago, one of the important characteristics of the blogging phenomenon is that people who otherwise would have no access to broadcasting are able to get their content (text, pictures, audio and video) delivered to interested people.  This perspective says that the barriers to creating the content are low enough now (typing, digital cameras, recorders, video cams etc.) that once the distribution (broadcasting) barriers go away a lot of people who have something to say/show are able to do it on their own. Podcasting represents a major lowering of the distribution barriers. The connection with this video?

My answer, maybe obvious, is this: a newsgroup is (typically) focused on a certain subject matter, and has many different people posting their comments and questions on that topic. So you follow a newsgroup because you are interested in a specific subject matter. A blog is (typically) focused on a certain author's voice, and often covers many different topics, of interest to the author. So you follow a blog because you are interested in a particular author 's point of view.

Folksonomies, as I understand, refers to a community based way of arriving at a taxonomy of information, basically subjective judgements on what the information is \" about.\" We've seen this in http://del.icio.us and in http://www.flickr.com. It seems to me that there are all kinds of meta data, some subjective, and some objective, which could use the general idea of collaborative classification.  For example within BlogBridge, a blog reader, we are building the ability for any user to identify the Country of origin of a certain feed. This is an objective fact, but not one that is easily ascertained.  We want to use the knowledge of the community to find out this fact. The experiment is to let any user record what they think the right country is, and relying (or betting) that this will be self-policing, and that people will not be inclined to hack or vandalize this item of information.  I think this is a useful generalization of the notion of folksonomies.

It takes about 10 minutes to be able to work it safely and then maybe another 30 to feel proficient. The machine seems really heavy and powerful. Heavier than I thought. Like a lawnmower heavy. While it doesn't move fast, it does have a lot of power so that when it wants to move, it just moves. I also came away feeling that the various towns and cities that decided not to certify them for sidewalk use, and instead treat them as motor vehicles were correct , surprising myself! Yes, it's easy and fun , but you know what, it's also not that hard to fall. A moment of distraction, and forgetting for an instant how to turn, and you can be flat on your face. Or you can crash into a person. And as I said, it's heavy. I am a great admirer of this machine, and I went into this experience feeling that those townfolks that wouldn't allow us to scurryi around on our Segways through central park just didn't get it. Well now I think they are right. I have to imagine it was that way when bicycles were first invented. (This is pure speculation, I have no idea of what actually happened.)  Yes it was a marvelous machine, apparently magical, riding on only two wheels. And yes, it was quiet and elegant and everyone thought they should get one. But I bet there was a period of 10 to 20 years when there were restrictions on their use and special training and special places to ride them.  I would say that kids would have had to be raised being tought how to ride them from parents, and that it really has to be internalized at an almost subconcsious level. My bet is the same has to happen with things like the Segway.</p>"},{"location":"2005/01/16/blogbridge-tip-send-us-feedback/","title":"BlogBridge tip: Send us Feedback","text":"<p>Link: BlogBridge tip: Send us Feedback: \"\"</p> <p>(Non-users of BlogBridge, this wil not be interesting to you.

As of now, my Windows box is off on a table 'over there' and my Mac is right here at my desk. Actually the switch happened yesterday and I've getting acclimated. Just for fun, I thought I'd record my experiences. Day 1-2: Basics are working. I am getting email with Mac Mail. I had to give up Trillian on Windows and tried using AVChat (the mac equivalent.) It's ok but not that functional. Since then I've tried AOL IM for Mac (not too much better) but stumbled across Adium, an open source (don't you love it?) Mac OS X-ified version of Gnu AIM (GAIM.)

Thunderbird is an email client and it's a very nice piece of work. You can see both of these apps here. I also recently read notice that there's a project starting to combine several Open Source projects into an email, calendaring, and address book behemoth. Might this challenge Microsoft Outlook? Sounds like an outlandish thought doesn't it? You might know that I am a big Microsoft fan. I've said that only they have the wherewithal to build, test and deliver massively complex software to huge user bases. Don't be fooled: simplicity is good, but good software is usually very complicated below the skin.  My read is that with successful efforts like FireFox and Thunderbird things may be getting interesting for Microsoft.

Many many people have blogged in great detail on this conference, so I won't try to improve on that, except for this great little aha! tidbit : All the discussion in one way or another centered around the question of how blogging affect journalism and journalism might affect blogging. Will blogging be the CB radio of the 2000's, to be remembered as a curiosity of the times, gone and mostly forgotten? Or, will blogging instead render MSM (mainstream media) obsolete, putting even the New York Times out of business?  The NYT? They are an institution. We all grew up with it. Everyone relies on it. They have a budget in the millions and revenues to match. Putting the NYT out of business is an outlandish exageration, that's what I think, and most of the room thought. So here was the aha!: Remember the Encyclopedia Britannica? Hmm.  \"They are an institution. We all grew up with it. Everyone relies on it.

David Weinberger points to a (beautifully designed : love those pictures!) essay on the topic from burningbird with lots of good quotes and pointers to other essays. Wow, a lot to read! In my mind the crucial thing about this new approach classification is that it gets around the achilles heel of the traditional approach of meta tagging or controlled vocabularies, which is, that most people just don 't do it. There are some special circumstances when a fixed list (or hierarchy) of categories or topics or tags will work for most people. But in the majority of cases, a fixed list of categories to apply to some item of information just causes frustration (\"the category I am looking for isn't there\") or confusion (\"What does tag X even mean?\") The end result is that information just gets mis-tagged or is left un-tagged. This is where so called folksonomies are so superior. Yes, often information will get misclassified. Whether this is so often as to render the whole system useless is an open question, which Technorati Tags, Del.icio.us and others will help us discover. p.s: One of the dangers to commenting on this discussion is that it is basically impossible to read all the essays and follow all the links and so you risk repeating what was already said.

And secondly that the only way to do that is to make it a point of being very familiar with other products, other approaches. As a designer of software I certainly believe in that. In fact,I have lived that over and over again: Improv learned from 1-2-3, eRoom learned from Lotus Notes, etc. And similarly, BlogBridge has begged, borrowed and stolen from all sorts of other applications, including NetFlix, Del.icio.us, Wiki's, numerous email clients and on and on. And not by accident but by conciously studying what others have done. That said, there are certain design choices which you can't straddle: they are fundamental - you have to pick. To bring it home with an example, many people far prefer web based aggregators (like Bloglines) over client based aggregators (like BlogBridge.) Each brings their advantages and will appeal to a certain subset of users, and this is important : they will be a turn-off for another subset of users. As a designer you have to make such choices while knowing that you will alienate some of the users you would hope to get, but counting on the fact that there is enough diversity in taste and work style to allow more than one model succeed.</p>"},{"location":"2005/02/03/social-networks-and-rss-aggregators/","title":"Social Networks and RSS Aggregators","text":"<p>Link: Social Networks and RSS Aggregators: \"\"</p> <p>Dave Winer says that there's a bit of buzz about social networks and RSS aggregators.

What do I mean by \"Social Networks and RSS Aggregators\"? Briefly, here's what we are doing with in in BlogBridge:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Any Feed being accessed through BlogBridge can be given a rating (one through five stars) by a user.</p> </li> <li> <p>Also, the user can attach one or more Tags to the Feed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Also, the user can indicate, if they happen to know, where the country of origin for that feed is.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The companion (free) BlogBridge Service receives this information, and collates and aggregates it in useful ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For example, the Country of Origin set by one user is visible (wiki- like) by all other users, the assumption being simply that people won't hack this, but if they happen to know that the blog comes for example from Iran, they can share that with the rest. This is a useful way to share factual, but not easily ascertained information.</p> </li> <li> <p>The tags users assign to a certain feed are also shared (del.icio.us- like) with all other users. The natural way of slicing and dicing will allow a user to see for example all feeds that the BlogBridge community has assigned the 'International' tag or the 'Secuirity' tag. This is a useful way to discover feeds that you would be interested in.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally the stars rating of a feed will be used to help users figure out (c ollaborative-filtering-like) which feeds are good and not so good.</p> </li> </ul> <p>We're not pretending we are curing cancer here, but there are some cool ideas that we are experimenting with which may or may not lead to something really useful.

My only consolation is that the next release of OS X will include something called \"SpotLight\" which is supposed to be totally amazing and will change my life. Plaxo - Who would have thunk? But this business of typing and maintaining people's contact information by hand can become pretty tiresome. I'd settle for a Mac version of GetAnagram.com, but that of course doesn't exist. Thinking about what software exists and doesn't exist on Mac, and why, can be sobering. I don't know the figures, but let's say that Mac accounts for 5 or so percent of the PC Installed base.

In both cases BlogBridge will analyze articles in feeds, looking for references to other feeds, on the assumption that if you like this feed, chances are good that you'd be interested in feeds that this one refers to. You can either analyze one particular feed, or all the feeds in a certain guide.  The process runs in background.

Tapping into your collective wisdom: the main point of this email We are organizing a small meeting in the Boston (USA) area to talk about what happens next with BlogBridge. It will be a chance to chat about your experiences with BlogBridge. But more importantly we'd like to talk about what direction to take the product and the project, in terms of both features and strategy. You will really be able to influence what comes next, both in terms of that little feature you always wanted, or a major new direction for the project. As a practical matter, I realize that many of you are far away from the Boston area and wouldn't be able to attend. But I am hoping that there are enough BlogBridge users in the Boston area to put together a good meeting. Date and location have not been set yet, but I would expect it to be some time in March, and likely in Waltham Massachusetts. Of course we'd be very glad to also engage in an email discussion on the BlogBridge developers mailing list: blogbridge-devl@lists.sourceforge.net. (Those of you on the yahoo groups list will notice that there's almost no traffic there.) I will publish interesting nuggets on my blog as well as things develop. Please let me/us know as soon as possible how interested you are in participating in this meeting. By the way, the meeting will happen no matter how many or few people decide that they can make it, but of course we would especially like YOU to come. Best, Pito Salas and the BlogBridge team</p>"},{"location":"2005/02/23/screencasting--screen--voice/","title":"screencasting \u2013 Screen + Voice = demo","text":"<p>Link: screencasting \u2013 Screen + Voice = demo: \"\"</p> <p>Jon Udell coins a term, screencasting: creating little informal movies from screen captures plus audio, used particularly for demonstrating softwaree and web features.

In my opinion, and agreeing with Kevin, Microsoft actually shows an absolutely amazing ability to develop, test, and deliver software of mind boggling complexity to a huge user base. They run unbelievably large scale beta tests, they support remarkable variety of hardware and software configurations, being run by every possible kind of customer, geography and user. IMHO there is no other organization on the planet that has this capability. Ok? But I have to take issue, in a big way , with this claim in Kevin's post: \" Other Microsoft products, like Money and Encarta, ship on an annual basis and hit those deadlines like clockwork.\" As many users of Microsoft Money will attest, the annual, clockwork releases are a farce to extract more cash out of people (like me) who fall into the trap of buying the upgrade.  Why do I keep falling into that trap myself? I really rely on Microsoft Money. I run my life on it. After receiving enough reminders that there's a new version out with bug fixes and new features I finally decide to go for it, and almost always regret it.

At the recent ETech conference there was more than one presentation on the topic, each of which helped me understand the subtleties a little better, and organize them in my mind. [What follows is fairly inside-baseball so if you are not particularly into this topic it will probably be somewhat obscure and likely not very interesting, so you are warned!] What are we to do with this term ' Tags'? It is used in many different places, sometimes to mean the same thing and sometimes something subtly different. This is not surprising about a set of ideas that are morphing right in front of our eyes and ears. So let's look at some examples and compare them. Let's look at tags in Flickr and tags in Del.icio.us (if you don't know one or the other, you owe it to yourself to look into them.)  Both have tags, but they are different in a subtle way:  In Flickr I am tagging my own stuff (pictures that I've uploaded) mostlyfor other people to find.  In Del.icio.us I am tagging mostly other people 's stuff (links to web pages) formy own benefit , that is organizing links of interest to me. Look at this:  One way to organize a taxonomy of folksonomies is to notice that there are two dimensions: Whose stuff is being tagged, and for whose benefit. Flickr ends up in the bottom right, and del.icio.us in the top left. But what about the other quadrants? This organization gives a new way of looking at conventional concepts like folders and directories on personal computers (my stuff/my own benefits) and Web based directories like Yahoo (other people 's stuff/other people's benefit.)</p>"},{"location":"2005/03/24/interesting-blog-survey/","title":"Interesting blog survey","text":"<p>Link: Interesting blog survey: \"\"</p> <p>Blogads has conducted a survey of people who read blogs.

(This is my interpretation, but I think it's pretty accurate.) BlogBridge is a feed reader with a primary goal to save the reader's time by collecting and using any information possible to help the user focus on what will be useful to them and ignoring the rest. So there's an excellent alignment between BlogBridge's goals and what Steve is trying to accomplish with Attention.xml. BlogBridge will support attention.xml. The section in Steve's post that is particularly interesting to me (and to BlogBridge) are his ideas on how to use Attention information to triage information being displayed in a feed reader - basically an outline of the kind of heuristics that might be used. It's a long section (in the second half of the post), so I won't quote it, but here's the tantalizing beginning:</p> <p>\" Why is this so important, at least to me? Because RSS is about time, and the data about lack of interest is intensely valuable to me as an indicator of what can be thrown out or pushed down the priority stack. As RSS takes hold, we are moving rapidly to a multiplicity of valuable content, where throwing out duplicates, redundancies, and repetitive analyses is key to providing enough of a window for absorbing the much greater signal-to-noise of the attention stream.\"</p> <p>If you are interested in this topic, I really recommend that you read Steve's whole post.</p>"},{"location":"2005/03/30/another-vc-is-blogging-/","title":"Another VC is blogging \u2013 what\u2019s going on?","text":"<p>Link: Another VC is blogging \u2013 what\u2019s going on?: \"\"</p> <p>If you are interested in some thoughtful perspectives about the world of Venture Capital , from a reformed (or is it a corrupted?) entrepreneur, you should check out Jeff Bussgang 's (of IDG Ventures) new blog, \"Seeing both sides.\" He's off to a great start!</p>"},{"location":"2005/03/31/geek-java-web-start-again/","title":"[GEEK] Java Web Start {again}","text":"<p>Link: [GEEK] Java Web Start {again}: \"\"</p> <p>There's another flame- up on the WebStart commentary on the web, this time under the title _\" Webstart, now I see why people don't use it.\" _Even though I've spoken out about this once or twice, I couldn't resist weighing in.Here's what I wrote:</p> <p>I have written so much about this in Blogs, newsgroups, etc that I won't rehash it here; however I will put some links below for those who are interested.

Help is hard to find, alternatives are non- existent. Briefly here is the story: I tried a 'better' Palm synchronizer called \"Missing Sync\" from Mark/Space. After using it for a little bit I decided it didn't really have too many advantages over the standard one, so I uninstalled it. But\u2026 I uninstalled it \"the wrong way.\" Who knew? Who knew that there is a wrong way to uninstall on Mac?  Anyway the result was that not only couldn't I continue using Missing Sync, I couldn't even continue using the original Palm HotSynch. It was exactly like what might happen on Windows XP with a corrupted registry entry or a wrong .DLLs. Every bit as bad.</p> <ul> <li> <p>I looked for a \"force uninstall\" utility for OS X. Can 't find one.</p> </li> <li> <p>I tried to call Missing Sync for help. Do they even exist? I got no response to email and phone calls for several days. Finally I got several, totally off the mark responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>I tried to get help from Sprint (who sold me my Treo Palm phone) - who knew exactly nothing about Macintosh.</p> </li> <li> <p>I tried getting help from Handspring who built the Treo, and again, nobody home - they bounced me back to Sprint.</p> </li> </ul> <p>*</p> <p>Anyway, it was hopeless. Finally with the help of some Mac expert friends, I went around deleting files and directories all over the place and was after lots of (scary) trial and error able to get the thing back to life. So, the lessons are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Uninstallation can be as dangerous as installation. Look for instructions about the 'right' way to uninstall</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the Mac market is so much smaller , expect much worse support and don't feel bad when you get the cold shoulder</p> </li> <li> <p>OS X isn 't perfect</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"2005/04/01/talking-about-rss-aggregators/","title":"Talking about RSS Aggregators","text":"<p>Link: Talking about RSS Aggregators: \"\"</p> <p>Doctor Scoble poses a provocative question: \"Which aggregator do you like best\"?

But notwithstanding that some of these brain-dead UI decisions bely the reputation of unsurpassed usability :</p> <ul> <li> <p>Where is the menu?

Huh?</p> </li> <li> <p>Keyboard Shortcuts everywhere Surprisingly there's a greater reliance on keyboard shortcuts on OS X than I ever saw on Windows. There are launchers to allow you to launch an app without looking for it on disk. Lots of useful functionality is only exposed with Shift-this or control-that or alt-the other thing. And then those wonderful little F-keys - a total of 16! But there are no keys to go to the start of a line (Control-A) or the end (Control-E). And no play, pause, etc. keys.

A lot of the fun is that it's new and different. Also I like the idea that there's UNIX beneath the skin because I wanted to get more familiar with it. Also all the applications are 'prettier ' to look at and that's fun. Of course the machine is blindingly fast but that's just because its so much newer than the pc it replaced. It is clearly more stable than Windows XP. But, it's not all perfect : It does crash sometimes, in mysterious ways. On Windows, I'd be impressed (and nervous) after about 3 days of uptime. On Mac that figure is more like 10 days. But stories about it staying up 6 months at a time don 't seem true. Also I don't understand the internals nearly as well so when some app misbehaves it's more mysterious to me. No cranking up of regedit and so on. I am gradually picking up how this works, but I am a long way behind where I was on Windows. The menu stuck to the top of the primary monitor is still ridiculous. The fact that there are so many keyboard shortcuts that you need to know to be efficient is silly. And that you have this tiny resize corner control instead of being able to use all edges to resize is also primitive. Net net - its a lot of fun, and I am glad I did it. If I was doing different kind of work I might think different \ud83d\ude42 But I am not in the camp that says that OS X is simply superior to Windows XP.

If you don't know the show, let me briefly tell you about one aspect, the voting model , which has raised some interesting questions.  Here 's how the voting works. Every week a set of contestants perform some song, and at the end \"America\" gets to vote on which one they liked best. Whoever wins the fewest votes that week is booted off and the following week the remaining contestants do it all over again. It has happened more than once that a contestant is booted off, who everyone agrees is among the best. And there's an outcry and wringing of hands about this - how could it happen? Is it racism? The votes are stacked! Here's what I think may be an explanation for oddball results on the polls.  When asked to vote for our favorite, my tendency would be NOT to vote for someone that I think is THE BEST, on the theory that they will get lots of votes from others and hence be SAFE anyway. No , I would vote for the one that I think is at risk of being booted even though I think they are great, the underdog , in other words.  If everyone did that, then it's possible that the one that everyone thought was the BEST would actually get booted!

There's a post and a thread about this here. Here's what you see if your application is signed with a verified certificate:  Is this an improvement? Yes. Is it good enough? No! IMHO the whole idea of using certificates to sign applications is fatally flawed. It provides illusory security.  As a small developer, all I have to do to make it go away is to spend some number of hundreds of dollars to get a certificate from Verisign or one of the many other CAs. When I do this, the message then becomes this:  How is the user any more secure?  Any malware developer could do the same thing. Of course they are smart enough so their company name wouldn't show up as \" Malware Developer\" and the application wouldn't be called \"Big Bad Virus.\" How is the user to know?

Here, I'll wait while you go and check out his post. _\" I would have written a different beginning to this story, roughly as follows: In winning and sustaining its monopoly in the operating system and browser markets, Microsoft has exposed countless millions of people to woes from security holes that have become conduits for viruses, worms and spyware. Now the software giant is planning to charge its captive customers to clean up the mess it created.\" _ Dan, we've done a TON of security work and distributed that to our customers for free (one of the largest operating system updates in our history, Windows XP Service Pack 2, was given away free). We've given away a beta of our AntiSpyware program for months now (after spending lots of money to buy the company that made it). (From Scoblizer)\"</p> <p>People living in the world of Windows may not know that in the most recent release of the Mac OS, \"Tiger \" there's a security hole so big you can drive a truck through it, that if it had been in Windows, there would have been hell to pay. So being that I live with a foot in each world, and being a fan of irony, I can't help but point it out \ud83d\ude42 One of the fairly neat features of Tiger is the so-called \"Dashboard\" - an environment to launch little handy applets (we used to call them Desk Accessories in the old days, remember? Dashboard calls them \"widgets\") I say fairly neat, because while they look very pretty, in practice they aren't that useful. They are practically a direct knockoff of a product called Konfabulator, which is available for Mac and Windows. But that's not the problem \u2026 [Update : the following paragraph has been clarified based on the comment below] The problem is that in the default settings of Tiger, Widgets are automatically downloaded and opened without any warning. Exactly how much of the widget code gets run simply by opening it is not totally clear, but feels quite dangerous, because widgets can contain arbitrary code, with full access to the underlying system. They can even run unix shell scripts! Now there's a simple setting ('Open \"safe\" files after downloading') which you can turn off to disable this risky behavior. But of course most users will never discover this setting or be aware of the risk. There has been quite a bit of handwringing about this in the Mac community, and speculation that Apple will fix this bug in the first rev of OS X Tiger. But in the meanwhile, let's see if any malware strikes. Certainly if the shoe had been on the other foot (or the shade on the other Windows) there would have been hell to pay for Microsoft!

This belief is so entrenched that I will probably be labelled as \"just doesn't get it\" by the cognecenti for saying that the emperor has no clothes. In many cases for most users, there's no additional safety. When users download an application that is not validly signed, they get various forms of ominous warnings about their computer being exposed to grave danger. So far so good. However if the certificate is valid, the speed bump is removed, they are happily told that the application was signed by for example \"Microsoft Corporation.\" and if they trust Microsoft they can download in comfort. That's the myth. There's the flaw. Why? Two reasons: first , many people use software from lesser known companies\u2026 Let's say the message is \"\u2026 if you trust software from Matrix Software in Madrid Spain\" then you can download in comfort. Even if you think you know Matrix Software, you certainly don't know whether in Madrid has other companies called Matrix Technology, or Matrix Inc., or Matrix Systems, each of which could be a malware producer.  Second, related reason: Let's say the message is \"\u2026 if you trust software from Sun in London, U.K. \u2026\" then you can download in comfort. How do you know if this is _the _Sun Microsystems that you thin it's about? The myth is promulgated every time a user is reminded that it's dangerous to run unsigned or not validly certified software and that it's perfectly safe to run certified software. As you can see, it's pretty easy for a malware provider to sign their software with a valid certificate and get the help from the OS vendors in gaining undeserved trust from end users.

So pulling out one story to make a point isn't really fair. (Especially recalling the story about stones and glass houses.)  But if I looked I know I could find story after story , including some that I could write from first hand experience, about the terrible rough edges on all the software on which our much beloved blogosphere runs. And from that observation and those stories comes the premise of this post. Here's one of the stories:</p> <p>\"It all started two weeks ago when I undertook the \" drop-in\" upgrade from Movable Type 3.14 to 3.17. Well, \"drop-in\" is not really the word. I had made some changes to my server configuration that I thought should not affect Movable Type and, in fact, did not for version 3.14.  However, because of a change in an open source library component that is a dependency for Movable Type 3.17, my configuration broke Movable Type 3.17. As a result, Movable Type was not properly pinging the technorati server to put my tagged links in their tag repositories. There were other smaller and larger issues that I independently tracked to this same dependency.\" (from \"The Community Engine Blog, Distributed Tagging Hell\", emphases added.)</p> <p>From my observation of this and many other stories, there is no blog server or service out there that I would call commercial grade. I don't see evidence that the current incumbents are going to deliver what is required. Here are some of the requirements for that, as I see them:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Installs reliably on any supported server. Doesn't require administrator to be a technical wizard. Once installed, stays installed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Measures up to enterprise requirements in scalability and security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integrates with other enterprise infrastructure, particularly databases, web servers, directories, access control and enablement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Is self evident to the end users, requiring minimal IT support during initial deployment and longer term adoption.</p> </li> </ul> <p>My bet is that with the growing prominence and publicity around blogging, around now is a good time to start a business to build just that. And let's not get clever about this\u2026 It's got to be recognizably a blog server, not some crazy adaptation of an existing product that gets the word \"blog\" slapped onto it. And on the other hand, not some wild hybrid of blog, wiki, and knowledge management. Just a really great, industrial strength, blogging system. I am convinced that such a beast would make money and that the time is finally ripe for it.  What is much less clear is whether it is sufficient to start a business.

With BlogBridge we have the BlogBridge Topic Experts. Global Voices have their collection of international blogs (very cool!) And of course, anyone using a feed reader or aggregator has their own list of subscriptions. Anyone who is making a list of blogs or feeds (or I suppose, URLs of any kind) that is not secret or private, would do well to record that in a simple OPML list. And the 'handle' to that list or collection is a URL. Lets see. Instead of telling people, you can find my list of best restaurant blogs as a BlogLines list, or as this html page, or as a BlogBridge Guide, you refer to that list by the URL of the OPML. It's a subtle shift: instead of thinking of OPML as a handy interchange format, start thinking of it as the most elemental format for representing a hierarchy on which all others are built.  (This insight is clearly inspired by Dave Winer's new OPML stuff, particularly the service which accepts and serves up OMPL files.) Going on. If this is a good way to think about things, then this argues that the OPML service and format at its core should remain minimalist. That as people decide to layer other semantics (as they will and should) onto their lists and hierarchies, that these be kept separate or separable from the OPML. I am not sure where this leads.

Microsoft Bloggers will give you a view into Microsoft's thinking, attitude, plans and challenges that is incredibly valuable. You (generally) won't learn any trade secrets. You will hear what you might have heard if you ran into this or that Microsoftie in a Starbucks or at a conference. But few people do. Exhibit #1 is a recent post by Steven Sinofsky, a very senior Microsoft manager, about how Microsoft thinks about management, how it structures its development teams, and what kind of people and performance it values.</p> <p>\"The typical organization in Office development is one where there is a group of about 5-8 developers (we'll use developers for this post, but the discussion is just points of the dev/test/pm triad) managed by a lead developer. That is the first level of management called a feature team. There are then 3-5 leads that report to a development manager. That is the second level of management, usually called a group. The development manager reports to a general manager or an executive manager that represents the place that development, testing, and program management come together. This structure is matched by development testing and program management (where there are about equal numbers of testers, and about half that number of program managers). The general manager or executive is where the product or technology comes together (think SharePoint, or Excel, or the new Office \"12\" user interface). In some groups, if there are a lot of products or a very large team there might be one additional level of management. I manage these general managers. My boss manages the overall Office P&amp;L, so marketing, finance, HR, etc. as well as other products report to him.\" (from What do managers do and how big should my team be?)</p> <p>If you have ever tried to develop a relationship with a Microsoft product group information like this, basic as it is, is really important.

If Walt Mossberg can be outraged at some piece of software being a little hard to use or crashing now and again, why not be as outraged at some piece of hardware not lasting more than 2 years?

While there is an OPML spec, having a validator too is a great, pragmatic , concrete way to give a big thumbs up or down to a particular piece of XML From the very start BlogBridge has supported OPML for import and export, as well as for various internal representations and communications. We obviously have done our best to write valid OPML, as best as we understood what that was.  Still, what trumps every theoretical position on OPML validity are user cries of: \"Hey, I can't import your OPML into XXX\", or \"Hey, you fail to import my OPML, but YYY has no problem with it.\" Our approach to this situation has been to follow what has been called \"Postel's Law\" (which I also learned from Dave Winer, ages ago): \"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.\" And this has worked well so far, although there have been some sticky wickets that we've had to deal with. You end up feeling like you are chasing your tail trying to accommodate all the odd dialects. So, it's great that Dave has now put forward the OPML validator. Running our stuff through it, we do quite well. Click here to see the results of running the validator against a pretty big example of our opml.  There are just two errors, each repeated multiple times:</p> <ol> <li> <p>_\" An  element with more than just a \"text\" attribute should have a \"type\" attribute indicating how the other attributes are to be interpreted.\" _ <li> <p>_\" An  element should only have known attributes.\" _ <p>__ In each case we have specified additional attributes beyond the basic ones. Specifically they are: rating, queryParam, queryType, tags, tagsDescription, tagsExtended and icon. Some of those probably deserve to become part of the core set, while others somehow will have to become part of an extensibility model. We'll participate in the discussions as they develop.

But if you think about Wikipedia articles work, they are actually meant to properly describe or define something that exists and has a name. In other words, they specifically are meant to be objective and timely. I've worked at more than one company where we, the CEO, or whoever was trying to write down , invent, or discover, for example, a company value statement , or a company strategy statement. It's a painful process on a lot of levels and when you are all done, it's not even clear that you've accomplished anything. What if you pretended that you were writing an entry in Wikipedia, for example of the company value statement. As a Wiki page, anyone in the organization could read, write, correct, update, clarify and append to the statement. It would be an interesting experiment if you could get it to work. If you did, you might have a better chance of getting some kind of common understanding and alignment, let alone buy in and agreement, than with other more top-down approaches.

It's an Amazon service generates solutions to little problems or tasks which are trivial for humans and impossible for computers (exaggerating a little here.) What kinds of problems are these? Oh say choosing what photograph best represents the storefront of the Border Cafe! What I imagine is this: Amazon has outsourced a bunch of SUVs equipped with digital cameras and a GPS to drive up and down all streets in the US. The cameras automatically snap picture after picture, each encoded with the current lat long. Using maps and directories each address will match several pictures. The remaining problem is to select the best one to represent the storefront. A very menial task, but one that requires a person. Enter Mechanical Turk. Anyone with an Amazon account can sign up and request to 'complete simple tasks that people do better than computers, and get paid for it.\" I tried this and was presented with sets of 3 to 6 photos. My job : decide which one most looks like the front door of say, Ernie's Body Shop, 1234 Main Hyway, Maine. I think each task paid something like 3 or 5 cents. Clever, eh? Even cooler, Amazon chose to build this as a totally general mechanism, with APIs for both sides of the transaction. API's to define tasks, check results, qualify workers etc..

From reading the discussions and thinking about it, I am thinking that a course correction might be better. Much of the discussion has been about an Attention namespace for OPML. I totally support this and will participate in that discussion.  Yet there are clearly some information that many aggregators need to store with the OPML, which is not part of the core OPML standard, and also not really connected to Attention.  Faced with this question an aggregator developer can do one of several things:</p> <ul> <li> <p>They can just create a product specific namespace (e.g. blogbridge: xxx)</p> </li> <li> <p>Or they can just include regular non namespace attributes in their OPML (which will in turn cause either the validator or other aggregators to choke.)</p> </li> </ul> <p>What if instead we try to define a general set of a ggregator r elated e xtensions (are:xxx) to OPML? We could do an informal canvas and try to figure out a small set of really obvious attributes to put into this ARE name space.  To start you thinking about this, here is a collection of attributes derived from what BlogBridge and FeedDemon each store in their OPML. I've identified two sets of attributes:  The following have to do with bookkeeping and the operation of the aggregator:</p> <ul> <li> <p>are:autoPurgeMaxitems - number of items that should be stored locally</p> </li> <li> <p>are:autoUpdateFrequency - how often this feed polled</p> </li> <li> <p>are:numUnread - number of items currently unread</p> </li> <li> <p>are:numFlagged - number of items currently flagged</p> </li> <li> <p>are:numVisits - How often a user has visited this feed</p> </li> <li> <p>are:firstPostDate - Date of the first post</p> </li> </ul> <p>And the following have to do with local user overrides of information that can also be specified in RSS.</p> <ul> <li> <p>are:userRating - user supplied rating of how 'good' this feed is</p> </li> <li> <p>are:userTitle - user supplied override to the title or name of this feed</p> </li> <li> <p>are:userCreator - user supplied override to the creator of this feed</p> </li> <li> <p>are:userDescription - user supplied override to the description of this feed</p> </li> </ul> <p>I'm sure these are already too many. My top level question to those of us responsible for OPML import and export within Aggregators of all kinds, what do you think? Shall we try to do this? Is it a good idea? Or shall we all just create our little parochial namespaces with different words for the same thing?

In the world of aggregators , the one of the original and core use of OPML was interoperability -- import and export of a user's set of subscriptions from one aggregator to the next. The potential voluminousness of attention information would harm OPMLs role as the universal interchange format between aggregators. Now the approach of using an app specific namespace for attention information is perfectly fine, as long as it is optional, and as long as aggregators can safely ignore it in cases when it doesn't matter. (I note that from a purely parochial development effort point of view, this is superior to a new format such as XOXO which aggregators generally aren't parsing nor generating.)

You can drag the vertical bar right and left to affect whether the recommended music is more in the popular or obscure range of possibilities. Cute!

Whatever the reason, I worry about the chilling effect this can have on innovation in our industry.  How many great new innovations have died on the vine because there was just no way for the creators to pay the rent while building the Next Big Thing? Even after a year, two years of development, the prospects for getting users to somehow compensate for the value delivered were small to none.  Is there another explanation?  What if this was a pure supply-demand invisible hand phenomenon? What if the platforms on which these systems are built (Apache, Tomcat, PHP, MYSql, Java, and so on) have become so rich and so powerful that it has become comparatively very cheap to build wonderful innovative systems like Furl, Rollyo or Reddit, and therefore the market was valuing them correctly at zero dollars. (My friend Shimon Rura put forth a case along those lines the other day. ) While there's an element of truth in this second explanation, I believe it is only a small part of the story.

I am pretty sure you've seen the announcement from Apple that their next generation of Macintosh computers will use Intel processors. Other than the industry melodrama about Steve Jobs embracing the very chips that for years he insulted, and perhaps bemusement of how Steve got that Intel Exec to dress up in a silly white costume while Steve looked cool in his traditional black turtle-neck. But other than that, who cares that Mac's are now going to have \"Intel Inside\"? I mean for me it's kind of like finding out that next year's model car is switching to a Bosch electronic ignition from a GM model. There's also been a lot of commentary on whether the new Intel based Macs would run Microsoft Windows. One the one hand it's again a bit gossipy: \"Would Apple bury the hatchet with Microsoft or would they spitefully prohibit (legally) or prevent (technically) this?\" There's a more interesting strategic question there though.  It relates to how Apple for years and years kept their software and hardware proprietary. Nobody but Apple could make Macs and no computers but Macs could run the Mac OS.  This new development opens the door a crack , and if Windows could run on the new Macs, it would open even further. The next natural question would be, could Mac's OS X Operating System run on a Dell? Would Apple permit it? How about this one : It is conceivable to me that Windows Vista would run better on Apple hardware than any other. Now wouldn't that be a hoot? How could that happen? Better in the sense of more reliably and robustly. Not because Apple designs better hardware than Dell (although they might.)  It could happen because Apple hardware is a lot more closed than PC compatible computers. The configurations that occur in the field are far more limited and well known. No old Acme Brand network cards or motherboards out there.  Hence Microsoft (and Apple) potentially will be able to deliver a more solid solution when combining WIndows Vista with Intel based Macs.

Each of us have almost non-overlapping networks so this is a chance for us to make new connections around town, and for you to do the same., This is like, totally totally informal! Anyone who reads this blog is invited. You don't have to be a geek, but you probably should like to hang out with them \ud83d\ude42  Expect the crowd to be, well, you know, technical types. We have no idea whether it will be just the three of us (which would be a bit embarassing\u2026 ) or who else will come. As it is totally informal there are no startup, setup or other commitments.

A slant on reading lists I've thought about are specialized lists that change their composition entirely on a periodic basis, a list in which none of the feeds you see today may be there next week.\" (from Churning urns of burning funk)</p> <p>True. And actually there are a lot of very interesting sources for reading lists which are not human experts but still make very interesting reading.  For example, you can get Feedster's Top 100 Blogs as a Reading List. The result using this hyperlink as a Reading List is a dynamic set of feeds, the Feedster 100, which is automatically changed whenever Feedster resorts their Top100. Almost more interesting, you can use Gada.be to compute a dynamic Reading List which is the result of a search query. So for example, interactively, here is Gada.be's search result for Chris Pirillo. And here is the same thing as a Reading List. The result of using this hyperlink as a Reading List is a set of feeds corresponding to the result of the search in a whole series of search engines.

(By the way, I am not exactly sure yet whether the water is literally blocked or is getting diverted into some waste reservoir.) The Capresso which I bought from WholeLatteLove (best price, free shipping) came with a free pound of coffee beans.

I believe the ground it too fine, and so I've had several batches of non-coffee - that is, the machine makes all the right sounds, but nothing comes out. As I mentioned in my previous post, the Capresso Ultima has a rather clever way of 'tamping' the coffee which uses a lever (and so muscle power) but in a way that's simple and fool proof.  Well almost. The only thing that's not exactly clear is how hard to push the lever down. Not too hard. Not too soft. So when no coffee comes out of the nozzle I am left with the question : was the grind too fine, or did I press too hard, or both?  I will let you know as I learn more. &lt;!-  </p> <p>google_ad_client = \"pub-7907243313795006\"; google_alternate_ad_url = \"http://www.blogbridge.com\"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = \"468x60_as\"; google_ad_type = \"text\"; google_ad_channel =\"7747325960\u2033; google_color_border = [\"FDEFD2\u2033,\"DFF2FD\",\"FDFFCA\",\"B0E0E6\u2033]; google_color_bg = [\"FDEFD2\u2033,\"DFF2FD\",\"FDFFCA\",\"FFFFFF\"]; google_color_link = [\"0000CC\",\"0000CC\",\"0000CC\",\"000000\u2033]; google_color_url = [\"008000\u2033,\"008000\u2033,\"008000\u2033,\"336699\"]; google_color_text = [\"000000\u2033,\"000000\u2033,\"000000\u2033,\"333333\"]; //-&gt;  src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\"&gt; Technorati Tags: capresso</p>"},{"location":"2006/04/26/coffee-series-part-3-trade/","title":"Coffee Series, Part 3: Trade offs","text":"<p>Link: Coffee Series, Part 3: Trade offs: \"\"</p> <p>First I was an instant coffee guy. Then I got into brewing whole pots, which led to my wasting a lot of coffee. Then, my friend Charlie started working at Keurig, and so I got exposed to that machine and how wonderful it was, and one year I got it as a Christmas gift.  We still use the Keurig a lot, but truth is that we've been going through about 10 K-Cups per Day! I was starting to notice that this wasn't a good deal. Not to speak of the Starbucks card which I'd been reloading from time to time. So you can see, I've worked myself up (or down) the evolutionary tree. Anyway, when I got interested in Espresso, I visited Williams- Sonoma several times to look at the different machines. The brand I had heard the most about was Capresso.  Without even getting into the outrageous price, I was eyeing the Capresso Impressa F9, F8 and so on. All fully automatic , meaning you put whole beans and water in one end and espresso comes out the other end. Wonderful. However, being Keurig fans, we had gotten used to being able to choose from cup to cup whether it was going to be caf, decaf, flavored or what not.  A key obstacle with these fully automatics for me was that you more or less had to commit to one kind of bean. It's true that in addition to the canister of beans there's a chute that bypasses all that and lets you send in ground coffee of any kind. But that kind of defeats the whole idea and didn't satisfy me. Plus, there was the outrageous price. So I discovered the Capresso Ultima. One way to think of this is that it's just like the fully automatic F9, but without the coffee grinding mechanism. Now that I've used the Ultima a bit it's also clear that it's a much simpler device both mechanically and electronically. And by the way it's way way cheaper.

Comment spam is when fake comments are added to a blog post that include links to some random site.

Whether it works for them I don't know, all I know is that it's a pain in the butt for me. I am now using a Movable Type plugin called HMPassphrase. It's very simple and effective. Whenever anyone wants to post a comment they have to read instructions on the web page and type in a certain word into a certain field. The word is right there in the instructions. It's super simple and yet the spam robots can 't read the instructions and so can't enter the magic word and so can't even submit a comment. In one magic stroke my comment spam has gone from 10 or so per day, to zero. Nice. p.s. I am also told that the WordPress Akismet spam filter plug-in is now available for Movable Type too and is very effective. But for now I guess I don't need it.

It's this massive, well organized and apparently solid Mp3 download site. Music is not free, but extremely cheap. It's apparently hosted in Russia or somewhere else. The question is of course, \"is it legal\" and \"is it ethical\"? Friends of mine who've known about it for years (claim to) never use it. I have to say it gives me pause to download the whole \"Tapestry\" Album (Carole King , from the Jurasic Period) for something like $1.50. Ridonculous. There apparently have been lawsuits trying to shut down the site. Just today I there's talk about another one: \"UK trade body to Sue AllofMp3.com\":</p> <p>\"The Russian music site sells copyrighted material for as little as 3p per track and claims to pay licence fees to the Russian Multimedia and Internet Society. However, the BPI said that the Russian body is not officially recognised and that UK copyright holders receive no fees for the tracks that are sold.\"</p> <p>Indeed, they themselves of course say that it's perfectly legal to use their sit. Apparently this is not the first time that someone tried to shut them down.  How about this: I actually own a vinyl copy of Tapestry. So, royalties have been paid to Carole King and whoever else. Does that change your view on the legality or fairness of using this site - if all you do is get mp3 copies of music you already have bought and paid for?

It's more than \"Consulting impartial people\" and a lot more than \"Searching your soul\". And while related, it's not the same as \"Give people a second chance.\" A second chance means that there are serious, firing-level problems but you hold your fire. http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=blogbridge-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0932633021&amp;IS1=1&amp;nou=1&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000ff&amp;bc1=ffffff&amp;bg1=ffffff&amp;f=ifr This is really \"give people a real first chance.\" Many managers just don't give the direct and honest and unvarnished feedback to someone well before things get to the point where you are considering firing them. Another one of my heroes is Gerald Weinberg, author of my all time favorite management book, \"Becoming a Technical Leader\" says: \"Everyone is doing the very best job they know how to, given the circumstances. \" Very often if someone is not doing the job, examine the circumstances carefully and honestly and you may well figure out a way to improve things.

Our design needs to reflect this. \"Take a moment today to look over your website. Is it really easy to use? Have you been more worried about the look of your website than its functionality?

All I can say is \"Utah is an amazing place.\" This is one of my favorite pictures taken at Bryce. It looks otherworldly to me\u2026 If you check out Flickr you can see the other pictures that I took while out there. I actually took over 400 so this was my first attempt at identifying the 100 best. Still sorting.</p> <p>Anyway, as you can see from the picture, Bryce is barren land, but amazing colors. Like many of the places we went to, it's basically a desert. The geologic structures seen here and elsewhere have to do with the fact that this section of Utah sits on the so-called Colorado plateau which was uplifted to 6-7 and -8 thousand feet at some part in the distant future.

Something which I think is useful or memorable often gets put down just so I can later remind myself of what I was thinking and working on at the time.</p> </li> <li> <p>It's definitely a kick to know that anyone on earth can read what I write, and in fact that thousands are doing so every day or so.</p> </li> <li> <p>I am obsessed with the phenomenon of blogging (viz. BlogBridge and related projects)</p> </li> <li> <p>It's a live, rich and personal testimony of who I am and what I am about, kind of an online professional reputation which is part of my professional persona and supports my consulting.</p> </li> <li> <p>I guess I love writing.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"2006/10/01/geek-playing-with-ruby-on/","title":"[GEEK] Playing with Ruby on Mac","text":"<p>Link: [GEEK] Playing with Ruby on Mac: \"\"</p> <p>I'm getting a little fascinated with Ruby and Rails so I've been getting acquainted with it.

Because of the numerous rounded (erosion) white (sandstone) mountains which reminded the explorers of the Capitol in Washington DC.

It's a memoir about one man's experiences as a totally out of control addict, then joining a rehab program and getting on the road to recovery.</p> <p>The problem is / was that after Oprah made all this fuss about James Frey, it turned out that certain details of the book were fictionalized. It was not exactly clear whether 10%, 20% or what were not from his real life experience. But Oprah threw a fit in a famous 'come to Oprah' episode where she publicly berated and humiliated James Frey for misleading Her and making her stake her reputation on a true life story which turned out not to be 100% true. It was good TV, but an unpleasant affair to watch. Even Wikipedia got into the act!</p> <p>Well I finally got around to reading this book. It is excellent, outstanding, informative, dramatic, well written and compelling. Frankly it matters not a wit whether it's 100% true or not.

I mean there are so many people working on aggregators, and after all Microsoft is building it into IE, and it's been in FireFox for a while. Why bother?</p> <p>I've thought all along, and I still believe, that all these blog readers, or aggregators, or whatever you want to call them are really important but still very primitive.</p> <p>I've also said and still believe that all of them, BlogBridge included , are very much generation zero, and are more or less following the same pattern, in a way set by email readers.</p> <p>The reason I am very bullish on this space(and I use that vague term on purpose) is that there is so much useful, general, non geek, high quality information out there, that such a large percentage of people have no idea about, and yet if they could see it they would devour it.</p> <p>Just recently I was reading Discover Magazine, and I came across an interesting article that mentions that mathematician Peter Woit has a blog called \"Not Even Wrong.\" I've not looked at that yet, but, I am intrigued. Every day I come across an example of that.</p> <p>So I say: Are you interested in Politics? Geology? Mathematics? Joint Ventures? Model Airplanes? Medicine? Rock and Roll? I can guarantee that I can find information on your passion that you will want to look at as often as you look at your magazine subscriptions.</p> <p>This is my belief: great stuff, regularly written, by experts in every field, is there (supply.) There is a large class of people who would stand up and cheer if we could bring that information to them easily.

For me the Top Ten Sources, which I know reasonably well, is the better analogy. Certainly Digg is hot but the reason it doesn't work for what I am talking about is that it bring you links to content or sites that (random) others have marked as interesting.</p> <p>A key part of the idea that I am groping for is that the user somehow tells what he or she is interested in.</p> <p>Example: Alice is interested in:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Cars</p> </li> <li> <p>Any article that Tom Friedman writes</p> </li> <li> <p>News about Belgium</p> </li> <li> <p>Classical Music</p> </li> </ul> <p>And with that very minimal bit of guidance this new product or service, if it is ever built, starts delivering articles, pictures, information to alice, Alice.

Rule 240 states that, if you miss a connection and it's the airlines fault (i.e. pilot doesn't show up, but not a snowstorm) then the airline is obligated to put on the next flight they have to your destination (free of charge) and if that's not possible, on another airline (free of charge.)

A few months ago they invited bloggers out to Seattle  to meet Bill Gates, with all expenses paid (hotel, airfare, etc). Last  week they send out a round of expensive laptops with Vista  preinstalled. These are not loans, by the way: they're completely free  laptops (\"yours to keep!\"). Here's the offer I received from a  Microsoft employee\u2026 [snip] </p> <p>Sounds nice, huh? What could be wrong with that?</p> <p>Robert Scoble says  \"it's an awesome idea.\" He says that as long as the bloggers disclose  that they got the laptops free, they're acting ethically. And he says  that Edelman is just \"doing their job,\" which is therefore by  definition ethical: </p> <p>On Edelman's side? Is sending out laptops ethical? Of course! That's  their job. </p> <p>Scoble is wrong.</p> <p>Just because it's someones job to do something, doesn't make it  ethical. Robert, your logic is faulty. Unless you want to assume that anything  that Edelman does in the name of promoting Microsoft is automatically  ethical, this logical argument you are making is simply false. For  example, if Edelman paid a bribe to a government official to  standardize on Windows, that would not be ethical, even  though it's their job. </p> <p>[snip\u2026]\" (End of quote of Joel on Software, from: Bribing  Bloggers)</p> <p>Yeah, I think that Joel is making a pretty good ethical argument.

If you record the precise position of the sun at the same  time every day, instead of being in exactly the same place every day,  it will traverse a figure eight, like in this image. This is an effect  caused by a combination of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, and  the tilt of the earth's axis. It can be a bit hard to visualize just  where the figure-eight shape comes from; the analemma site uses a  combination of diagrams and animations to make it extremely clear, and  works through the entire process of demonstrating where each component  of the analemma comes from, and deriving the equations that describe  it.

In return,  Turner Broadcasting and Interference won't face charges. Here's the  basic breakdown - $1 million goes to reimbursing state and local law  enforcement for their troubles. Another $1 million will go to  \"goodwill\" funds. </p> <p>Here's a more detailed breakdown of which agency gets what from the  attorney general's press release: State Police - $691,126 Executive  Office of Transportation /Mass. Highway Dept. - $45,466 MBTA -  $630,396 Massport - $8,380 City of Boston - $484,590 City of  Somerville - $69,113 City of Cambridge - $24,794 US Coast Guard  - $46,136 </p> <p>Of special note: The MBTA will get $132,772 in additional restitution  and $315,198 in \"homeland security and community initiative funds.\"  This is your chance for more green, MBTA. Use it wisely. </p> <p>The budget for  the movie is listed on the Internet Movie Database as $750,000.  Even if settlement is a drop in the bucket for Turner Broadcasting,  that's still a hefty marketing campaign budget. </p> <p>The settlement also came surprisingly fast, which suggests that all  parties involved wanted to move on. Boston is embarrassed and Turner  is embarrassed.

I think I might have gotten fired in the dream\u2026</p>"},{"location":"2007/04/26/a-good-analysis-of-the/","title":"A good analysis of the recent (very insider) dust-up over interviews","text":"<p>Link: A good analysis of the recent (very insider) dust-up over interviews: \"\"</p> <p>Check out this post from BuzzMachine:</p> <p>The interview is outmoded and needs to be rethought.</p> <p>There\u2019s no better demonstration of this than the recriprocal snipes we\u2019ve been seeing from and around Wired magazine from its attempt to interview people about Michael Arrington. (If you know the tale, skip to the next paragraph.) See Jason Calacanis\u2019 quite reasonable effort to respond to Wired writer Fred Vogelstein\u2019s questions via email and Dave Winer\u2019s equally reasonable offer to respond in public on his blog. Now see the blunderbuss response from Wired in a blog post by Vogelstein recounting the email exchange and his dogmatic rules \u2014 \u201cI never do email questions right out of the gate\u2026\u201d \u2014 and also in a blog post from his colleague Dylan Tweney, calling Calacanis \u201ccowardly\u201d (it appears to be an awkward attempt to be cute) and in an even clumsier attack from Ryan Singel: \u201cWhat happens when a top tech figure has an online soap box, a Silicon Valley-size ego, millions in the bank and a grudge against the mainstream media?\u201d Arrington piped in, fearing the fuss would cost him his publicity. And unable to resist any post about Arrington, Valleywag joined the journalism seminar. Vogelstein \u2014 who came to Kofi Annan agreement to record an interview with Calacanis \u2014 emailed me, too, but I told him I was about to blog about this snit and he probably wouldn\u2019t want me. Finally, Wired Editor Chris Anderson joined in, saying in a comment on Calacanis\u2019 blog, \u201cI don\u2019t impose any one policy.\u201d</p> <p>But maybe, given your vow of radical transparency at the magazine, Chris, you might want to at least impose openness to new ways, or at least an open discussion about the state of the art of the interview in the time of the empowered interviewee. A few discussion points:</p> <p>Who says that reporters are in charge of interviews anymore? Why should they set terms? They are the ones who are seeking information. As Calacanis pointed out in their email exchange, Vogelstein was willing to give up two interviews because the subjects would not follow his rules. So the story suffers \u2014 it\u2019s less complete, less informative, or less accurate \u2014 because of the reporter\u2019s controlling rules? That wouldn\u2019t make me happy as an editor, subject, or reader. If you need the information, shouldn\u2019t you be willing to get it however you can? Isn\u2019t that what reporting is all about?</p> <p>Are interviews about information or gotcha moments? Vogelstein said in his email that he wants phone interviews to get the tone of the subject. Why? If this is about information, what does that really add? Or is it about the reporter\u2019s effort to characterize the players in a narrative? Is this about information or drama? As a subject, wouldn\u2019t you be wary of that? Or does the reporter want to catch the subject in a slip of the tongue? But what does that really accomplish? Isn\u2019t it better to get considered, complete answers? What\u2019s so wrong with enabling a subject to think about an answer, to review it and get it right before sending it? Isn\u2019t accuracy and completeness the goal? When I came up in the business, I was taught not to review quotes with subjects before publication but now I see magazines doing just that; as Valleywag points out, reporters even negotiate quote approval. The only reason not to do that is that you don\u2019t want to ruin the gotcha moment: \u2018You said that.\u2019 \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t mean it.\u2019 \u2018But you said it. Gotcha.\u2019 \u2018But it\u2019s wrong, so can\u2019t we correct that?\u2019 \u2018Gotcha.\u2019 We\u2019ve all misspoken. Should we be able to take back our own words? The only reason not to is if the reporter believes he has indeed caught us. And there is a place for catching people (George Allen couldn\u2019t take back \u201cmacaca\u201d). But in most stories, that\u2019s simply not the case, unless your agenda is to get someone.</p> <p>Too many reporters get too much wrong. Listen to what both Calacanis and Winer \u2014 not to mention veteran journalist Dan Gillmor \u2014 are saying: They\u2019ve been burned when their words in stories end up incomplete or wrong. Gillmor\u2019s right that reporters should be the subjects of stories to learn what it\u2019s like to be on the other end of that pen. I\u2019ve certainly learned that lesson myself.And by making complete interviews public, as Calacanis insisted, even on audio, we get to check the reporter. If, again, the goal is accuracy, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.</p> <p>There\u2019s a better way. Try combining the Calacanis and Winer methods: Perform the interview in writing, in public. As Winer says: \u201cSo if you want to work together, let\u2019s find a new way to do it. I\u2019m fed up with the old system. The way we start the reboot is to do all our work out in the open, real-time. Not via email, but in full view of everyone.\u201d Examine the possible benefits of this: The reporter asks a question and I answer it. But I get it wrong and a reader pipes in to give a correction. Isn\u2019t that a better way? I read my answers as I write them and improve them myself. What\u2019s wrong with that? Why should the reporter get the opportunity to rewrite and edit and I don\u2019t? Why should the reporter get to look smarter than the subjects? The best reporters, after all, go to find people who are smarter and know more than they do to get the best story. Ah, but I can hear some of you saying, wouldn\u2019t this blow an exclusive? Well the exclusive has a fleeting value of about 30 seconds anymore anyway. And what\u2019s exclusive about what Dave Winer has to say about Mike Arrington? If anyone owns that exclusive, it\u2019s Dave, no? And Dave\u2019s stance is that if he has anything to say on a subject, he\u2019ll say it on his blog. Welcome to the transparent era, my fellow journalists. You want transparency? This is transparency.</p> <p>My words are mine. Enough said.</p> <p>Quotes need no longer be taken out of context. Isn\u2019t that the greatest problem subjects have with how their words are treated? But that need no longer be a complaint. Why shouldn\u2019t every quote, every snippet and soundbite, link to its context in the fuller interview? If the reporter has done a great job on the story, no one need click on those links. But if you want more or if you want to investigate the context in which this person said this thing, why not make that readily available, now that we have the ability, thanks to hyperlinks and permalinks? In fact, doesn\u2019t this change the very structure of the story? Why shouldn\u2019t that change, too? I\u2019ve been arguing for sometime that online, there\u2019s no reason to insert the standard background paragraph when you can link to full background. Ditto for interviews. Think of the finished story as a summary, a guide to more information. It may give you everything you want. Or it may link you to background if you\u2019re new to the tale. Or it may link you to more depth if you want to dig deeper. Every story becomes a table of contents to knowledge. Let\u2019s not just reexamine the interview. Let\u2019s reexamine the architecture of the article.</p> <p>Interviews and articles need never end. And never start. A story can begin with a reader\u2019s blog post: \u2018I wish I knew\u2026\u2019 Or it can begin with a reporter\u2019s blog post: \u2018I\u2019m looking at doing a story about ____. What do you know? What do you want to know? What should I ask? Whom should I ask?\u2019 Who says the reporters should ask all the questions? Shouldn\u2019t the readers? Shouldn\u2019t even the subjects (good interviewers usually ask whether there\u2019s anything they didn\u2019t ask)? Then the interviews can appear online to be challenged, amended, and corrected by writers, readers, and subjects alike. Why shouldn\u2019t it be a collaborative effort when it can be? Won\u2019t that only yield better information? Then the reporter writes a story. Make no mistake: There is still and always will be great value in that. For the vast majority of subjects and stories, I don\u2019t want to go digging through original material and reporting-in-progress. I want the reporter to do the work of packaging it for me. Absolutely. So the article remains a keystone. But who says the story should be over then \u2014 done, fishwrap \u2014 just because the reporter\u2019s finished writing it? The story is online and as we see every day, it continues to live and grow as people add their knowledge and perspectives and corrections via links and comments and remixes of the information. So the article isn\u2019t a product. It is a process. It is collaborative. It is three-dimensional, linking to background and depth. It\u2019s alive.</p> <p>Yes, it is a favor. Vogelstein said in his email to Jason that \u201cno one talks to me to do me any favors.\u201d Oh, they most certainly do. In our gift economy, every act of sharing is an act of generosity, a favor. No reporter or reader should ever forget that. This is the essential human trait that makes the internet \u2014 let alone libraries, newspapers, and magazines \u2014 valuable. Reporters think that they are the ones doing the subjects the favor and, indeed, that used to be the case and to a lesser and lesser extent, for some, it still is: The reporter holds the key to the presses and with the reporter\u2019s choices \u2014 \u2018I\u2019ll quote you but not you\u2019 \u2014 the reporter grants attention, publicity, legitimacy. Or that\u2019s the way they thought it worked. But this is the essential lesson of the democratization of media: We don\u2019t need you and your presses to be heard. Calacanis in his email to Vogelstein: \u201cBesides I have 10,000 people come to my blog every day\u2013i don\u2019t need wired to talk to the tech industry.\u201d Winer: \u201cLike Jason, I don\u2019t have any trouble getting my ideas out on my own.\u201d Or hear the students at Virginia Tech who got sick of reporters bugging them about the stories they\u2019d already told on their own .</p> <p>That should force reporters to reexamine the human economics of the interview: because they have to and because they can, because the power dynamics of journalist-subject have changed and because they now have new tools to do interviews \u2014 and articles \u2014 in better ways. Why not at least try?</p> <p>Vogelstein wanted to talk to me about Arrington. But I didn\u2019t want to talk to him about that. I wanted to talk to him about this. And I just did it, in writing, in public. And I hope he talks back and that you will, too. Yes, news really is a conversation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, elsewhere at Wired, they are trying radical new ways working with Jay Rosen and NewAssignment.net on their Assignment Zero. I was interviewed via email and posted the results immediately, as did the reporter; they also solicited questions and wrote about doing interviews this way. Not a lot of conversation around that because I was long-winded, pontifical, and boring. But hey, the internet and conversation are meritocracies. We talk about what\u2019s worth talking about.</p> <p> </p> <p>(from: The obsolete interview)</p>"},{"location":"2007/04/27/are-you-blind-to-a/","title":"Are you blind to a great bargain?","text":"<p>Link: Are you blind to a great bargain?: \"\"</p> <p>Here's a column that I can really relate to, and a topic that I've written about more than once before.</p> <p>\"Computers would be nothing without programs to run on them, so why do we spend so much time drooling over our hardware -- physical bits and pieces -- and so little over the software that makes the bits and pieces do what we want them to?

And why are we so stingy about paying for software?</p> <p>These thoughts were running through my mind the other day as I read the exchanges on a mailing list devoted to a piece of software I follow closely (a thought organizer called PersonalBrain, which I'll be taking a closer look at in a forthcoming column). When its creator, California-based Harlan Hugh, unveiled the pricing structure of the latest version of the program, there was a collective intake of breath among users. One, a doctoral student from Florida, exclaimed: \"I stopped breathing for few seconds when I read the price.\"</p> <p>It's true, the jump in price might sound heart-stoppingly steep -- to more than three times the cost of the previous version. But we're not talking massive amounts of money here -- $250, in fact, which nowadays wouldn't get you much more than dinner for two in a posh restaurant. And the people balking at shelling out are the same ones who are passionate enough about the software to spend their spare time reading and contributing to a mailing list entirely devoted to it.</p> <p>The problem is that we users haven't yet come to terms with what software really is. We understand hardware -- wires, chips, silicon, more wires -- and can see it and touch it. It isn't hard to attach a value to that. But software is, well, soft. It's intangible. And we are still struggling to grasp the fact that hardware is a commodity, and software isn't. Which leaves software and the people who make it in a constant struggle to both produce something and find a way of making money from it.</p> <p>Take Singaporean Joe Goh, for example. Mr. Goh produces a small tool called FunkeeStory (funkeemonk.com/funkeestory) that does one thing for one select group of people: backs up SMS text messages from a Treo smart phone to a Mac. He's been at it full-time for a year now, and is making between one and three sales a day. He's just about eking out a living, he says, as long as he keeps costs low. He still regrets an early decision: cutting the price from $24.95 to $19.95 in the panic of a quiet first week after launching last year. Even so, he still gets emails saying his tool is too expensive. \"That's when it hit me,\" he says. \"No matter [at what level] I price my software, there will always be people out there complaining.\"</p> <p>All the free software out there puts further pressure on prices. No one today, for example, is going to pay for a browser, because you can get good ones free. Part of the blame lies with Microsoft, which has long given away its Internet Explorer. But the Open Source movement -- where volunteers contribute to writing software that is then usually made available to users gratis -- has also contributed with its Firefox browser.</p> <p>It isn't as if people aren't making money out of software: Microsoft still charges an arm and a leg for its Office Suite: between $250 and $350 in the mid-1990s, against $150 to $680 now. Others have switched to different pricing models. McAfee VirusScan, for example, was a very popular antivirus program in the mid-'90s, selling for a one-time price of $65. Now people cough up the same price every year for a subscription.</p> <p>The rise of Web-based applications that sit in your browser is also supporting the idea that software should, at least for simple tasks, be free. Google offers basic word processing and spreadsheet applications online at no charge, while other companies, like developer 37 Signals with its collaboration tool Highrise (www.highrisehq.com), offer free basic versions of Web-based programs and charge for advanced features like storage or sharing.</p> <p>I have no quarrel with this kind of innovation. And the more stuff that's available without shelling out a lot of cash, the better for us as users. But I suspect that, too, it reinforces a growing perception that software is an entitlement, something we just grab out of the refrigerator when we need it. It isn't: It's the lifeblood that flows through the veins of our devices. We need to recognize that what we get out of our machines is nearly all due to software, and the brains that created and that maintain it require food to keep doing so. Sure, the likes of Microsoft probably don't need every one of us to shell out $600 for Office. But the real innovators have always been small artisanal developers, beavering away in obscurity and hoping to make a living. If we keep thinking that software is something that should be free, then, in the words of Singapore-based software developer Bernard Teo, we may find that there aren't many of those people around: \"If a developer is not careful, he may find that it's simply not worth his time building and supporting his product, if consumers continue to expect low, low prices without limit.\"</p> <p>Next time you balk at paying $30 for a program, think about how little that really is.</p>"},{"location":"2007/04/30/using-a-cell-phone-while/","title":"Using a cell phone while out of the USA","text":"<p>Link: Using a cell phone while out of the USA: \"\"</p> <p>Lately, for some crazy reason, I've found myself, multiple times, in Toronto, Canada, and Willemstad Cura\u00e7ao.

ALLOFMP3 has up-to-date licenses from the Russian Licensing Societies from the Federation of Rights Holders for Collective Management of Copyright with Respect to the Use of Musical Works in Interactive Regime (FAIR) and from the Russian Organization on Collective Management of Rights of Authors and Other Right Holders in Multimedia, Digital Networks &amp; Visual Arts (ROMS).</p> <p>Russian Copyright Law allows holders of intellectual property rights to establish non-profit organizations such as ROMS which in its capacity oversees licensing agreements and collects royalties and pays them out to copyright holders, aside from some commissions.\" (from P2Pnet talks to AllofMp3)</p> <p>And here is another one that is kind of amusing.

It mentions something that I've been thinking about too.</p> <p>Is [tag]Facebook[/tag] the new [tag]America Online[/tag]? Here's what I mean: Back in the bad old days, there were services like AOL, [tag]Compuserve[/tag] which were very popular. I was a committed user.</p> <p>Built-in information sources, built-in instant messaging, built-in ecommerce, built-in email, built-in search, single signon. Life was good. Nothing new to learn.</p> <p>But of course we all use the web today which has disaggregated all these, taking advantage of open protocols and formats like HTTP, HTML, and so on. Now I can (and do) use Email from Google, Search from Google (hmm..) and oh yes, eCommerce from Amazon, Craig's List, Ebay, and on, and on and on. I can pick and choose and am not stuck with what AOL or Compuserve decides I need.</p> <p>Over time AOL incorporated mini-versions of popular web sites to stem the tide. You could order books for example, from Amazon or Barnes and Noble (not sure which) but not both. Maybe you plan travel either with Expedia or Travelocity, but not both. Depends on who was able to make a deal with AOL.</p> <p>We are seeing the exact same pattern develop in Facebook. Facebook has an API which AOL didn't have. But it's Facebook's API, not a web API, and that makes all the difference.</p> <p>Think about what happens when MySpace and every other social network also has an API. And what happens when Google gets into the social graph business?</p> <p>Here's Doc Searls take on it and what got me thinking:</p> <p>\"Here\u2019s the problem. For me, anyway.</p> <p>I believe the Net is an open place. Same with the Web.</p> <p>I also believe private walled gardens on the Web are fine things. Nothing wrong with them.</p> <p>My problem is when the former starts looking and acting like the latter. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m already tired of Facebook. The \u201cfriend request\u201d list (top item to the left there) is one I\u2019ve whittled down from a much higher number. If I could gang-whittle them, I might be more interested, but the routine still involves declining to check off which of many different ways I met somebody (\u201dboth owned the same dog\u201d, \u201cset up by a mutual ex-boss\u201d or whatever), and other time-sucks. Not to mention that the site takes many seconds to load, or to bring up email, or whatever. At least for me.</p> <p>The big challenge for Facebook, as it has been for AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple and everybody else who ever ran a walled garden, is to make their \u201cplatform\u201d something that sits on the Net and the Web, not something that substitutes for it. Facebook\u2019s mail, for example, is a substitute. If there\u2019s a way I could get Facebook mail with my IMAP or POP client, I\u2019d rather do that. (Can you, by the way? I doubt it, but I dunno.)</p> <p>Anyway, lif\u2019e\u2019s too short, and this list of stuff is too long. If you\u2019re waiting for me to respond to a poke or an invitation,or a burp or any of that other stuff, don\u2019t hold your breath. Or take offense.

For each inmate put to death, the studies say, 3 to 18 murders are prevented.</p> <p>The effect is most pronounced, according to some studies, in Texas and other states that execute condemned inmates relatively often and relatively quickly.</p> <p>The studies, performed by economists in the past decade, compare the number of executions in different jurisdictions with homicide rates over time \u2014 while trying to eliminate the effects of crime rates, conviction rates and other factors \u2014 and say that murder rates tend to fall as executions rise. One influential study looked at 3,054 counties over two decades. \" (from the New York Times)</p> <p>It seems to me that there's a key flaw in that study and analysis.</p> <p>Let's say there's a correlation between the number of executions and the crime rate. What if we randomly selected people to be executed in each district, no matter whether they were guilty of a crime or not. Would that also deter crime and 'save lives'? These studies imply that they would. It goes to the heart of one of the key arguments against capital punishment, which is the equal application of the law.

I just came across this amazing little service called the DigPageRank Pagerank Checker. The story goes something like this.</p> <p>Google assigns every single page in the whole internet a numerical score called the Page Rank (PR). It somehow says something about how important that page is and consequently how high it should appear in your Google search results.</p> <p>Like Astrology , you can find lots of debate all around the web on how PR is computed, whether it means something or not. And when Google tweaks their algorithms so that a particular web page goes up or down in PR, then this is big news in the SEO community. It's a fact that where your site shows up in search results can have a dramatic financial impact on your business.</p> <p>So it's a world of move/countermove - a veritable arms race as Google tweaks it's algorithm and web sites try to game the algorithm to raise their Page Rank. And back and forth.</p> <p>So back to this site the PageRank Checker. Type in a URL you will see not simply the PageRank of said referenced page, but what the Page Rank is of that page according to dozens of separate Google data centers.</p> <p>What I find so fascinating about this report is that it raises the lid on the unbelievably complex super-parallel-global-spanning-computer-brain that Google has become.</p> <p>I had heard about these data centers, but that there are so many, and that the analysis of the PR of a certain page potentially yields different numbers is interesting. It means that the PR calculation is done somehow separately in these data centers, it says that probably the algorithm for computing the PR can potentially actually be different (presumably as a result of their update distribution mechanism.)</p> <p>Maybe the Google brain will, like Colossus, \"wake up\" and become the global consciousness, hack into the military computers around the world on it's own initiative and black mail \u2026 oh forget it.</p>","tags":["pagerank-countermeasures-colossus-mon-tagey-ecommerce"]},{"location":"2007/11/21/shakey-bakey-security/","title":"Shakey-bakey Security","text":"<p>Link: Shakey-bakey Security: \"\"</p> <p>\"Establishing a secure wireless link between two gadgets could soon be purely a matter of holding them together and applying a vigorous shake.\" (from NewScientistTech)</p>"},{"location":"2007/11/22/the-time-machine-works/","title":"The Time Machine Works!","text":"<p>Link: The Time Machine Works!: \"\"</p> <p>Check out this post from blog.payne.org:</p> <p>Well, I can report that Time Machine (the new back-up &amp; restore utility for Mac OS X) works.

But now, in the section that says what platforms the software runs on there is a list of entries of type computer operating system. So when I am editing the entry for BlogBridge, and I want to correct or add to the list of computer operating system it runs on, Freebase already knows the list of known operating systems.</p> <p>Interactively on the web, it's quite interesting, but it really makes your head spin when you contemplate what it means as an internet API.

So, like many things I got into, it was pretty much an experiment, pretty random.</p> </li> <li> <p>\"What drives you to blog about something?\" It varies. Often I discover something, figure something out, see something that piques my interest. Working solo, I don't have the outlet that I used to have while working in an office to pop over to someone and share my insight, joy, amusement, amazement, whatever. No office to pop over to. So this blog becomes an outlet for that same impulse. Now that I have a (bit of) an audience (see all my posts about Search Engine Optimization) there are occasionally other motivations, like wanting to bring attention to something or someone by linking to it from this blog.</p> </li> <li> <p>\"How has blogging affected you?\" I can't say it has affected me that much. I go through spurts of blogging and not blogging and I always enjoy it. It's kind of my personal scratch pad or notebook of stuff that I want to get out of my head and 'down on paper' and so it's enjoyable. Now that I've been doing it for several years, I have quite a public record on what I care about, believe, am interested in and so on, so, for better or for worse, this blog has become a significant component of my public resum\u00e9 or reputation.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"2007/12/08/computer-science-theory-and-practice/","title":"Computer Science: Theory and Practice","text":"<p>Link: Computer Science: Theory and Practice: \"\"</p> <p>Joel Spolsky of Joel on Software gave an outstanding talk at Yale which he has written up on his blog.

The question is, how to do that.</p> <p>I explored three options with them: create a Facebook 'Group' and/or Application, create a Ning social network, or create a new and beautifully designed new web site to serve as the hub of the effort.</p> <p>Here are some of my tentative conclusions.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Outreach: No matter what approach is taken, a big part of the effort will be outreach, via email or google ads or something along those lines, to get the attention of these people, and motivate/incent them to register. The message, tone, language and incentive have to be carefully designed and monitored and tweaked to make it work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Design and Look: Facebook will allow the least customization of the look, followed by Ning, and of course creating a new site will give you any design you want. But don 't get all caught up in how important having a unique look is. There is something to be said for the familiarity and trust that a Facebook-looking group elicits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost: There is a similar trade-off in cost: A Facebook group will be the cheapest, a Ning site a little more, and a custom web site will almost certainly cost much more than you expect.</p> </li> <li> <p>Facebook has captured a lot of the 'social graph': This one is the hardest to explain because my point is subtle. [I await comments from someone saying that this point isn't subtle at all] Facebook 's magic is that it has already recorded many relationships, who is who's friend etc. They are trying to 'capture the social graph' So, it is much easier to encourage John to tell his friend Jane to also join this group because neither John or Jane have to 'sign up' - create a profile. So this is one unique advantage of using Facebook, assuming that there is reasonable overlap between Facebook users and the people we are trying to find.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Those are some of my insights in assessing the trade-offs.

I would be surprised if there's not a grab bag of PHP, Java, C, SQL stored procedures and other technologies in the overall architecture. So the notion of 'abandoning Rails for Java' doesn't really make much sense anyway.</li> <li>Most important: Designing, building and operating a system to achieve good performance at Twitter scale is really really hard no matter what language or framework you use.

Intellectually, it makes perfect sense, but it still creeps me out.\" (from a comment to Scoble's post)</p> <p>and finally\u2026</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, the image defaults to the side of the street with Starbucks. You'll have to click the film strip for the opposite side of Church Street.\" (again from Darwinian Web)</p> <p>Which brings up Mechanical Turk, the new, totally clever Amazon service which some have written about but somehow seem to have escaped Scoble's all-seeing- eye.</p> <p>So what is Mechanical Turk (see this for the origin of the name)? It's an Amazon service generates solutions to little problems or tasks which are trivial for humans and impossible for computers (exaggerating a little here.) What kinds of problems are these? Oh say choosing what photograph best represents the storefront of the Border Cafe!</p> <p>What I imagine is this: Amazon has outsourced a bunch of SUVs equipped with digital cameras and a GPS to drive up and down all streets in the US. The cameras automatically snap picture after picture, each encoded with the current lat long. Using maps and directories each address will match several pictures. The remaining problem is to select the best one to represent the storefront. A very menial task, but one that requires a person.</p> <p>Enter Mechanical Turk. Anyone with an Amazon account can sign up and request to 'complete simple tasks that people do better than computers, and get paid for it.\" I tried this and was presented with sets of 3 to 6 photos. My job : decide which one most looks like the front door of say, Ernie's Body Shop, 1234 Main Hyway, Maine. I think each task paid something like 3 or 5 cents. Clever, eh?</p> <p>Even cooler, Amazon chose to build this as a totally general mechanism, with APIs for both sides of the transaction. API's to define tasks, check results, qualify workers etc.. And APIs to work on problems and suggest solutions. Pure genius!</p> <p>So, let's say I have a task like, answer the question: \"Is this web page a blog or not?\" (a question that might be of interest to BlogBridge) I could:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a list of URLs that I want to check out</p> </li> <li> <p>Add them to Mechanical Turk as projects</p> </li> <li> <p>Seek out only workers who could show that they knew what a blog is (by submitting to some test questions)</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide how much I wanted to spend</p> </li> <li> <p>And turn the problem loose on people around the globe.</p> </li> </ol> <p>You know everyone always fawning over Google. Don't get me wrong, I think Google is great and I've done my own share of fawning.</p> <p>However, in my book, Amazon is the unsung hero in the new Web 2.0 world. They are every bit as innovative and cool as Google, and they do it while somehow inventorying and delivering gazillions of books and other products around the globe.</p>"},{"location":"2008/05/29/why-should-do-online-check/","title":"Why should do online check-in when flying?","text":"<p>Link: Why should do online check-in when flying?: \"\"</p> <p>This, from American Airlines:</p> <p>\"Your trip is eligible for check-in now.

And why are we so stingy about paying for software?</p> <p>These thoughts were running through my mind the other day as I read the exchanges on a mailing list devoted to a piece of software I follow closely (a thought organizer called PersonalBrain, which I'll be taking a closer look at in a forthcoming column). When its creator, California-based Harlan Hugh, unveiled the pricing structure of the latest version of the program, there was a collective intake of breath among users. One, a doctoral student from Florida, exclaimed: \"I stopped breathing for few seconds when I read the price.\"</p> <p>It's true, the jump in price might sound heart-stoppingly steep -- to more than three times the cost of the previous version. But we're not talking massive amounts of money here -- $250, in fact, which nowadays wouldn't get you much more than dinner for two in a posh restaurant. And the people balking at shelling out are the same ones who are passionate enough about the software to spend their spare time reading and contributing to a mailing list entirely devoted to it.</p> <p>The problem is that we users haven't yet come to terms with what software really is. We understand hardware -- wires, chips, silicon, more wires -- and can see it and touch it. It isn't hard to attach a value to that. But software is, well, soft. It's intangible. And we are still struggling to grasp the fact that hardware is a commodity, and software isn't. Which leaves software and the people who make it in a constant struggle to both produce something and find a way of making money from it.</p> <p>Take Singaporean Joe Goh, for example. Mr. Goh produces a small tool called FunkeeStory (funkeemonk.com/funkeestory) that does one thing for one select group of people: backs up SMS text messages from a Treo smart phone to a Mac. He's been at it full-time for a year now, and is making between one and three sales a day. He's just about eking out a living, he says, as long as he keeps costs low. He still regrets an early decision: cutting the price from $24.95 to $19.95 in the panic of a quiet first week after launching last year. Even so, he still gets emails saying his tool is too expensive. \"That's when it hit me,\" he says. \"No matter [at what level] I price my software, there will always be people out there complaining.\"</p> <p>All the free software out there puts further pressure on prices. No one today, for example, is going to pay for a browser, because you can get good ones free. Part of the blame lies with Microsoft, which has long given away its Internet Explorer. But the Open Source movement -- where volunteers contribute to writing software that is then usually made available to users gratis -- has also contributed with its Firefox browser.</p> <p>It isn't as if people aren't making money out of software: Microsoft still charges an arm and a leg for its Office Suite: between $250 and $350 in the mid-1990s, against $150 to $680 now. Others have switched to different pricing models. McAfee VirusScan, for example, was a very popular antivirus program in the mid-'90s, selling for a one-time price of $65. Now people cough up the same price every year for a subscription.</p> <p>The rise of Web-based applications that sit in your browser is also supporting the idea that software should, at least for simple tasks, be free. Google offers basic word processing and spreadsheet applications online at no charge, while other companies, like developer 37 Signals with its collaboration tool Highrise (www.highrisehq.com), offer free basic versions of Web-based programs and charge for advanced features like storage or sharing.</p> <p>I have no quarrel with this kind of innovation. And the more stuff that's available without shelling out a lot of cash, the better for us as users. But I suspect that, too, it reinforces a growing perception that software is an entitlement, something we just grab out of the refrigerator when we need it. It isn't: It's the lifeblood that flows through the veins of our devices. We need to recognize that what we get out of our machines is nearly all due to software, and the brains that created and that maintain it require food to keep doing so. Sure, the likes of Microsoft probably don't need every one of us to shell out $600 for Office. But the real innovators have always been small artisanal developers, beavering away in obscurity and hoping to make a living. If we keep thinking that software is something that should be free, then, in the words of Singapore-based software developer Bernard Teo, we may find that there aren't many of those people around: \"If a developer is not careful, he may find that it's simply not worth his time building and supporting his product, if consumers continue to expect low, low prices without limit.\"</p> <p>Next time you balk at paying $30 for a program, think about how little that really is.</p> <p>Originally posted on Apr 29, 2007.

And then all of a sudden you had two of the greatest accounting misstatements in history. You had all kinds of management malfeasance, and it all came out. And, of course, the classic thing was that after it all came out, OFHEO wrote a 350-340 page report examining what went wrong, and they blamed the management, they blamed the directors, they blamed the audit committee. They didn't have a word in there about themselves, and they're the ones that 200 people were going to work every day with just two companies to think about. It just shows the problems of regulation.</p> <p>QUICK: That sounds like an argument against regulation, though.

They promptly dispatched us to Benton, NH, apparently half an hour from the Canadian border.</p> <p>We arrived at around 11:00am and stayed until around 4:00pm. We were asked to call back to the Plymouth office once we had arrived to let them know what was going on. We received no instructions on what to do, where to stand, and what to expect.The only other sign holder was standing for a NH State Rep, Charlie Chandler. There was no sign for John McCain.</p> <p>This photo shows me in front of the Benton Town Office which is a smallish two room building which apparently serves as town administration and town hall building for Benton.</p> <p>Democracy in action. In conversations with the town moderator, we learned about the process. There was one curtained handicapped voting booth, equiped for hearing and vision impaired people. There is a telephone in the booth to allow them to call in their vote. They even provide for voters who are paralyzed and who can only communicate by blowing into a straw.</p> <p>There were some tables with about 6 officials sitting in various spots. At the close of the day, these folks manually tally the results, I am sure everyone checking each other, and then the results are called into the State Attorney General. They are given a password a week ahead of time so when they call in they can authenticate themselves.</p> <p>The town of Benton has (according to what they told me) around 250 elegible voters. It is a tiny place. When you hear the candiates talk about \"the cities and towns and hamlets of New Hampshire\", well this is barely a hamlet.</p> <p>In fact everyone was very pleasant and nice. In addition to being open for voting, the town was having a bake sale. Residents had baked cookies (\"Wine Cookies\") breads (homemade english muffins), soups, sweets and all kind of stuff. The funds all go into the towns general funds.</p> <p>We were told that \"this is McCain Country,\" not in a mean way but just in sympathy that we had been asked to volunteer in a place that was basically a lost cause already. It didn't seem that way to us. We had several voters give us a secret thumbs up, and some poll workers telling us that they were proud to see Obama represented by us. We didn't have high hopes, but yesterday when the results were published, it turned out that in Benton, McCain got 94 votes and Obama got 85 votes. Very close!</p> <p>So McCain still won Benton, but it was far closer than we thought it would be.</p> <p>All in all, I was impressed at how decentralized the whole process is.

Evangelized (and perhaps coined) by Doc Searls, it has developed a strong following. In their words:</p> <p>\"VRM, or Vendor Relationship Management, is the reciprocal of CRM or Customer Relationship Management. It provides customers with tools for engaging with vendors in ways that work for both parties.</p> <p>CRM systems for the duration have borne the full burden of relating with customers. VRM will provide customers with the means to bear some of that weight, and to help make markets work for both vendors and customers \u2014 in ways that don't require the former to \"lock in\" the latter\" (from Project VRM)</p> <p>That definition is still fairly opaque for me.</p> <p>I find it easier to explain by simple example: Today, Amazon keeps track of all their customers and near-customers (like wish list users, web site visitors, etc.) in a huge database. VRM says that instead, the individual should own information about themselves and make it available to Amazon (and other vendors) as desired.</p> <p>The database that Amazon keeps contains personal, commercial, demographic and interest information. It's their CRM (\"Customer Relationship Management system.) This database is hugely valuable to them as a way to sell stuff but also as a way to market stuff. VRM's perspective is that information actually should be under the explicit control of individuals. They should decide who gets to see it and they should share in the commercial or non commercial value of this information.</p> <p>VRM is a compelling concept. If VRM intrigues you, here's the ProjectVRM blog, you may want to start following it.</p> <p>It's not easy to see how it will get built.

After all, you assume that the passwords never leave Quicken's files on your computer, but you don't really know that.) When I describe Mint to people, many of them freak out at this point.</p> <p>Reading Mint's extensive security FAQ, what they say is that they don't store or remember any of that information.

As we go through life, we travel through institutions \u2014 first family and school, then the institutions of a profession or a craft.</p> <p>Each of these institutions comes with certain rules and obligations that tell us how to do what we\u2019re supposed to do.

Here's where I come out:</p> <ul> <li> <p>I don't believe any politician, left or right. They are all lying. Ok, they would call it \"framing\" but the fact is there are no facts (I am a little more inclined to believe the President, but even there\u2026)</p> </li> <li> <p>I know that I can't personally determine whether tax breaks are stimulative or not, or whether government spending is stimulative or not, let alone whether either one will 'work'.</p> </li> <li> <p>I decide to believe experts I whose opinion and prescriptions I read in the newspapers and hear on TV. I look for experts who don't have an axe to grind and seem intelligent, thoughtful, and not a shill for one or the other party.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You may ask, then, what do I read and what do I watch? In the end, the person who I have decided is making the most sense is Paul Krugman. He happens to appear in the papers and tv stations I watch. So I side with his prescriptions:</p> <p>\"A not-so-funny thing happened on the way to economic recovery.

We like to think that we're too busy to volunteer, but it's not true. We don't volunteer because we don't want to. Why? Either because we don't care enough about giving back to our communities or today 's volunteer opportunities aren't suited to our lifestyles. Being an optimist, I'm opting for the latter. And so, a corollary is required:</p> <p>Volunteerism excludes most of us: Why? Because it asks us for a kind of time that few of us can give. We've got a few minutes while waiting for the bus to play Texas Hold'em on our mobile phones. We've got an hour to watch our favorite TV show on a weeknight. And we've got 15 minutes to read Vogue in the dentist's office. What we don't have is two-plus hours on a Saturday. That's prime leisure, family, and catch-up time. It's the most valuable kind of time we've got. It's expensive. Volunteerism excludes most of us by asking for something that's beyond what we're prepared to give. So we don't.\"</p> <p>This rings true to me.

And they were there to evaluate the soundness and the accounting and all of that. Two companies were all they had to regulate. OFHEO has over 200 employees now. They have a budget now that's $65 million a year, and all they have to do is look at two companies. I mean, you know, I look at more than two companies. </p> <p>QUICK: Mm-hmm.</p> <p>Mr. BUFFETT: And they sat there, made reports to the Congress, you can get them on the Internet, every year. And, in fact, they reported to Sarbanes and Oxley every year. And they went-wrote 100 page reports, and they said, 'We've looked at these people and their standards are fine and their directors are fine and everything was fine.' And then all of a sudden you had two of the greatest accounting misstatements in history. You had all kinds of management malfeasance, and it all came out. And, of course, the classic thing was that after it all came out, OFHEO wrote a 350-340 page report examining what went wrong, and they blamed the management, they blamed the directors, they blamed the audit committee. They didn't have a word in there about themselves, and they're the ones that 200 people were going to work every day with just two companies to think about. It just shows the problems of regulation.</p> <p>QUICK: That sounds like an argument against regulation, though. Is that what you're saying?</p> <p>Mr. BUFFETT: It's an argument explaining-it's an argument that managing complex financial institutions where the management wants to deceive you can be very, very difficult.</p> <p>\" (from: from Newmark's Door)</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>Originally posted on Oct 04, 2008.

But he stopped short of condemning the Iran security forces for cracking down on demonstrators and said Washington does not know whether the allegations of fraud are, in fact, true.\" (from \"Top Cleric Calls for Inquiry as Protesters Defy Ban in Iran\")</p> <p>I don't know of course, but I want to make a case that the notion of 'the true result' is a difficult one, in an of itself. This of course has applicability here as well, where we have elections being questioned in various parts of country. Presumably we would like to know who 'really' won in Minnesota and so on.</p> <p>Here's a thought experiment.</p> <p>Let's assume that you can, with 100% confidence, collect all and only the cast ballots from an election in one place. Let's say there are a hundred boxes sitting on a pallet, with security guards and live web cams.</p> <p>Ask yourself, is there an objective, theoretically correct tabulation of these ballots? Is there a 'right answer'? And so the job of the election process is to come up with a set of procedures and devices to determine that right answer?</p> <p>Oddly, I say that the answer is \"no\". There's no 'right answer'. There's always subjectivity involved. Why? Well let's take some examples, from here in the US, but I say similar examples exist no matter how ballots are designed and votes are counted.</p> <p>For example, in most states there is a requirement that a paper ballot be filled in by fully filling in the circles in front of the candidates that you choose, and that there are no other marks on the ballot. In fact the rule is that any stray marks on the ballot make it invalid and not counted.</p> <p>In practice it happens often that a voter marks a circle part way, then crosses that out and clearly marks another candidate. Or that a voter, instead of filling the circle in front of their candidate, instead draws a big circle around the candidate's name. Or that they fill in a write-in candidate, but neglect to fill in the circle in front of the name. In each of these cases, they have 'technically' and 'legally' made their ballot invalid. Theoretically these ballots should not be counted.</p> <p>Now here's where it gets interesting : in fact the purpose or goal of the law is to capture 'voter intent ' - what did the voter mean? Even if they did not follow the instructions precisely, is it clear who they wanted to vote for?</p> <p>This is but one of many ways in which, even if the law is clear, the adjudication of the ballot is subject to interpretation. There is no specific objective, theoretically correct tabulation of that ballot. Wow.</p> <p>So when the vote is close, the losing candidate has a chance to argue about each voter's intent based on what they scribbled on the ballot. That's why recounts can go on and on and end up in the Supreme Court.  And that's why the question of what the 'true' count is of an election in the final analysis doesn't have a real objective answer. (Even you can guarantee (which you can 't) that you have all and only the legally voted ballots in a particular election, another 'fact' that actually doesn't have an objective meaning.)</p> <p>[disclaimer: I am not an elections expert, this is what I have come to understand from fairly extensive, but still non-expert, study of how elections work.]</p>"},{"location":"2009/06/19/geeky-rmagick-and-memory-leaks/","title":"[Geeky] RMagick and memory leaks","text":"<p>Link: [Geeky] RMagick and memory leaks: \"\"</p> <p>A recent post talked about creating a \"Domain Specific Language\" for image processing of ballots. I've made a lot of progress on that project and wanted to give an update.</p> <p>One commenter (my pal Aleks) said to 'watch out for RMagick as it has major memory leaks. I talked to him further and he recommended using MiniMagick instead. I investigated.</p> <p>It turns out indeed that my RMagick app was gobbling up tons of memory.</p> <p>Both RMagick and MiniMagick are Ruby bindings to ImageMagick which is a comprehensive image processing library, written in C I believe. The differences between RMagick and Mini Magick are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>RMagick uses the ImageMagick API and presents a comprehensive 'rubyfication' of the ImageMagtick api. This is useful but you do find that you jump back and forth between the RMagick doc and the ImageMagick doc to see what methods in one correspond to which ones in the other. MiniMagick on the other hand is a very thin veneer over ImageMagick's command line utilities. It generally uses 'method-not-found' to decide to invoke the corresponding C method. This means that the ImageMagick doc is your primary source. The MiniMagick source itself is a single tiny (but sophisticated) Ruby script.</p> </li> <li> <p>RMagick creates in memory ImageMagick ('malloc') objects and retains pointers to those inside of Ruby structures. Unless those Ruby structures are garbage collected, the ImageMagick objects just hang around and eat memory, hence the memory leak reputation. Because as far as Ruby is concerned, not that much memory has been used yet, natural garbage collections don't occur and your system memory footprint gets bigger and bigger.</p> </li> <li> <p>MiniMagick works only with files; it never creates the ImageMagick malloc objects and hence does not suffer from the memory leak. On the other hand, with a complex process like what I am working on, you are creating, saving and reading a lot of files, which slows things down.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I did nearly a day of coding comparing the two and while MiniMagick made the memory leaks go away, in the end it was slower for my purposes than RMagick, probably due to the files that were constantly being created, opened and saved. Note after a few dozen complicated operations, the RMagick version got super slow and basically hung because of memory consumption.</p> <p>That was easily solved with a little research. I found a post that explained how to address the apparent memory leaks in RMagick: I added a forced reclamation of the ImageMagick malloc object whenever I am done with one (Image.destroy! is the call) and the huge leak is gone. Not sure yet whether there are other ones, but for now, RMagick wins for me!</p>"},{"location":"2009/06/24/can-electronic-voting-machines-be/","title":"Can \u2018Electronic Voting Machines\u2019 be \u2018Trusted\u2019?","text":"<p>Link: Can \u2018Electronic Voting Machines\u2019 be \u2018Trusted\u2019?: \"\"</p> <p>Leaving aside what exactly an Electronic Voting Machine is , the New York Times weighed in with this editorial the other day:</p> <p>\"Electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper record of every vote cast cannot be trusted.

I thought I would capture some of the tidbits because there might be something useful here for you</p> <ol> <li> <p>To set the scene, this is a new Mac Pro (the tower, Intel, 64bit, running Snow Leopard) replacing an old Power Mac (the old tower, PowerPC, 32bit, running Leopard.) You can stop now if you're a PC. To the untrained eye, these computers are exactly the same inside and out. But wait.</p> </li> <li> <p>Based on past experiences (with all computers) I decided not to let the automated process 'move over' the stuff from the Old to the New computer. Instead, this is a good moment to get rid of all the dreck that has accumulated over the years and start with a clean slate. Good choice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Moving over my considerable size iTunes library ran into snags. Not moving it, that was easy, but discovering a bunch of music that didn't play anymore.</p> </li> <li> <p>The new iTunes 9 has a very nice new feature (called Home Share) which solves the problem of having several computers in the house and several iPods, and constantly having to move songs from one to the other etc. Instead you can have iTunes publish the whole library in a way that other computers at home can see, and in addition (and this is the new part) import onto the other computer. So I simply Home Shared the library on the Old computer, and then went to the new one, and imported the whole thing. Very nice.</p> </li> <li> <p>But some songs said, \"This computer is not Authorized.\" Etc. What I discovered was that you can go to a song like that, on the old computer, and look at the info box, where it will show what old email account you had used when you first ripped that song from your CD, and then simply go to the new computer and \"Authorize\" it on that email address.</p> </li> <li> <p>Which works just fine, as long as those email addresses all correspond to various iTunes Store accounts you've had over the years. I had 4 and I remembered all their passwords, and all was good. So here's a headline: it is perfectly possible to Authorize one iTunes install with multiple iTunes account. Any particular iTunes account can only be Authorized with 5 iTunes installs though. Very confusing, the world of DRM!</p> </li> <li> <p>But, I discovered a handful of songs in my iTunes library that were associated with an email address that I never used in iTunes. So when I try to play one of those, they say, this computer is not Authorized, please Authorize it. And then when you try to Authorize it, it asks iTunes Store, who says \"Never heard of this guy\", and essentially the effect is that those songs cannot be played.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cannot be played, even though they were copied from physical CDs that you own!</p> </li> <li> <p>My theory is that I ripped those particular CDs, by mistake, with AAC encoding, which is Apple's DRM encoding. But for some mysterious reason the resulting files are associated with a nonsense email (don't know where they came from) and therefore they cannot be read!</p> </li> <li> <p>The Apple \"Specialist/Expert\" was totally useless in solving this problem. I am now trying to prove that this is somehow the result of the new iTunes.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Hope that some tidbit in that is a little useful to someone.

My colleague Prof. Jennifer Rexford gave a great talk to a group of our incoming engineering Ph.D. students, about how to make the most of graduate school. Here 's what she said: ]</p> <p>Those of you who know me, know that I collect quotations as a hobby. (The short version of the story is that I moved around a lot as a kid. Quotations are small and very portable, making them a good hobby.) Anyway, two eminent scientists, Albert Einstein and Lewis Thomas, who were at Princeton the 1930s both have something interesting (and seemingly contradictory) to say about the role of the individual: </p> <p>Albert Einstein (physics): \"All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual.\"</p> <p>Lewis Thomas (medicine, biology, Princeton class of '33): \"There is really no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin.\"</p> <p>These two quotations embody so much of what graduate school is all about.</p> <p>Individual Development</p> <p>First, graduate school is a highly individual experience. Compared to the somewhat anonymous experience of college -- where you sit in large classes, do the same homeworks, and take the same tests with many other students -- graduate school is a highly personal. Nobody else is doing quite the same research you are doing (or at least you hope they are not), and you get direct (sometimes pointed) feedback on your individual work -- from your advisor, from your peers, and from reviewers of the papers you submit and the talks you give. And when your work is good but not great, you don't just take the A- and move on to the next assignment -- you keep plugging away and get more feedback and, eventually, you nail it. This is an amazingly efficient way to learn, grow, and create great scholarship.</p> <p>Yet, there is a downside. The critique of your work, however well-meaning and \"good for you,\" will sometimes feel relentless. It requires some toughening of the skin, and a delicate little dance to simultaneously be in love with your work (so you have the tenacity you need to always dig deeper) and yet have enough emotional distance to be able to take constructive criticism of how your work looks in its early stages. It's not an easy balance to strike, and I'm sure all of us who do research still struggle with it. I know I do. This is one of the many ways in which grad school is as much as emotional challenge as it is an intellectual one.</p> <p>Another important aspect of the \"individual\" in graduate school is to learn your research \"taste.\" You may not know it yet, but you are weird. You come to research problems with some peculiar sensibility that nobody else has. You are attracted to a certain kind of research problem -- maybe a messy practical problem, or a sharply formulated (but very hard) theoretical problem, or something in between. You notice a certain kind of weakness or gap in other people's research. You have a particular set of techniques or approaches to solving problems. Graduate school is a wonderful time to figure out what your \"taste\" is, so you can craft your own agenda for the technical problems you pursue in the years ahead.</p> <p>So, then, graduate school really is the epitome of what Einstein called the \"development of the individual.\" And I hope during your time here, you get the kind of opportunities for individual development that you deserve. Experiences that will let you produce deeper scholarship that expands the base of knowledge in your fields, and become more accomplished at conveying new and sometimes complex ideas to others.</p> <p>Part of a Group</p> <p>Yet, for all of my blathering on about the individual, graduate school is also a collective experience. You are part of a research group, a department, a discipline, (for many of you) an engineering school, a graduate school, and student groups like GWISE.</p> <p>I want to say a few words about your research group, because it is so important. Your officemates, and the other graduate students around you, are such an important part of your graduate school experience. Not only do they provide a sense of community, and a community that truly understands your experiences, though that is certainly important. But they also mentor you on topics small and large.</p> <p>I had a great officemate, Jim, in graduate school. He took ten years to graduate, and had already been there seven years when I arrived. So, Jim knew everything about everything. He taught me an important lesson I value to this day -- how to be efficient. He would sit at the next desk and admonishingly say, \"Jen, I hear the sounds of repetitive keystrokes. Today you will learn Perl.\" To be honest, it was kind of creepy at first, but Jim would watch out for me out of the corner of his eye. He taught me things that would save me time, leaving me with the time and energy I needed to tackle bigger and more interesting problems.</p> <p>Your classmates will also provide wonderful moments of professional serendipity, random encounters over coffee or foosball that make you aware of a body of work you didn't know about, or recognize a previously unappreciated connection between two disciplines. You may even become the match-maker for the faculty, bringing two professors together to collaborate because you see a connection in their research that they were unable to see. The chance encounters, the candid feedback on your research, the unplanned discussions about research taste and philosophy -- these are all a great part of interacting with your group mates.</p> <p>I must caution you, though, about an important enemy against this kind of informal interactions. The Internet. Okay, so my research focuses on the Internet, so it may seem strange for me to be so negative about it, but this is important so I'll make an exception. The Internet makes it far too easy to work from home, or a cafe, or on the train, rather than in your office or lab with your peers. Your choice to work away from the office is, in fact, perfectly rational. Coming into the office has a defined cost, in terms of your time and (perhaps) having to get out of your pajamas and take a shower. And, all of this is in exchange for some vague, speculative benefit -- that you might have a chance encounter that truly changes your research. And, frankly, in any one day, you probably won 't have a profound experience in your office, and your officemates may not even be in the same scholarly mood as you. But, I entreat you to go anyway.</p> <p>And, I encourage you to have a broader sense of community with each other, whether in your departments, or the school of engineering, or in groups like this one. Not only for the professional serendipity -- though that will happen. But for the friendship and support. Graduate school is fun but it is also hard, and sometimes frustrating, and having some balance in your life will make the whole experience more worthwhile.</p> <p>In fact, for what it's worth, I find the students in my group who are more engaged with other students and student groups often graduate sooner than the other students. They often are better at managing their time, working intensely and efficiently to leave space in their lives for their other pursuits. And, they are more comfortable reaching out to other students for help, whether for feedback on a paper or guidance on an analytical technique or a software tool. They know more about the peculiarities of the faculty, and how to work around them. And, for the students who are not native English speakers, the social interactions also have a side benefit of sharpening their English skills. Mastering a language is, frankly, pretty boring work. Socializing in English is a much more enjoyable way to learn the language than any formal study could ever be.</p> <p>So, in closing, I do think that graduate school is an unusual experience, both highly individual (in your training and professional development) and highly collective (in how you are part of a research group, a discipline, and a larger community). I hope you find both aspects of your time here at Princeton rewarding, and that you also make time to give back to the next group of students who arrive at Princeton after you.

The elders, The Elders, were no longer around, or visible even. But their influence certainly was felt.</p> <p>Yes, their Designees, in uniforms and head gear, were always around, and apparently in control. But really, they rarely meddled in these small disputes. Or was it a small dispute? Would it turn into something ugly to be retold over and over as plans were made for the future?</p> <p>First contact, in fact, had happened quietly, so quietly, it would have been easy to miss it. Or did it even happen? The problem lay in the system, or Method, that the Elders had established, but more of that later.</p> <p>The first hint of a possible incursion came when, sightless, the outposts at the extreme edge of the border detected some movement. Now thinking back, you have to admit that calling it a border is misleading. Each Corpus in turn would test and nudge to see the resistance that would be met, and the risk that could be taken. Neither party wanted to escalate, and this is usually the way detente was maintained.</p> <p>But in this case, first contact occurred, quietly, while mostly no one was really paying attention, and while one side was arming and preparing for confrontation, the other, attending to other matters was unaware until, suddenly they were. Alarms were sent up the chain of command, and also across. The diplomatic corps immediately brought into the decision - what was the recent history of the relationship? The Intelligence (we called it that, but really it was more like a Defence) branch activated the tactical response machinery, manned the situation room, and raised, sharply raised, the sensor scanning across all parts and all borders. And the Legal unit was called up.</p> <p>Under the rules and traditions, the original intent of the elders, who as you recall were no longer around, what were our rights under law? Certainly we, the innocents, would never want to be the ones to have overreacted to an accidental probe across, lets face it, a vaguely defined border area. More than vaguely defined, it was disputed.</p> <p>The elders. Those who came before us, had been confronted with a problem -- far too little land for far too many communities. Yes the communities, each quite small, were vying for this space. Without a legal framework, anyone could see there would have been trouble, lots of trouble. The Communities, for they were not families (sometimes they were,) certainly were loyal to each other. And they did share with the others a tradition - a sense of higher purpose and direction.</p> <p>But other than that they were all over the map when it came to raw force and power, and the willingness to enter battle, even over seemingly tiny issues. The Elders saw this and devised a plan which was simple in its concept and fit well with the physical geography.</p> <p>As it came to pass, each member of each community would be assigned a minimal rectangular space: the world became a checkerboard of tiny private plots, and communities located in different areas with a plot per inhabitant. Orderly, which was the mindset of the elders, and manageable by Designees, long after the elders had turned their attention to other matters, other universes, other planes.</p> <p>Now, the battle was becoming ugly. First contact had been in the distant past, and what started as an apparently minor, perhaps even accidental contact, was threatening to turn into an out and out tug of war. Each side seemed to be ready to dig in. The Mids (the good guys) were feeling pressure to brace for a major incursion, a multi-point attack, but in an area that was so remote that it had been detected late. The Iles (the bad guys) had cleverly used a distraction caused by the Designees patrolling up and down (as they were wont to do) to move a major arm of their forces directly into the airspace of their neighbor.</p> <p>The three teams, assembled in the situation room, came together in emergency session. A decision had to be made, in minutes, about how to respond. If Intelligence, Diplomacy and Legal could not decide, and respond, quickly, the borders would be redrawn perhaps permanently.</p>"},{"location":"2010/10/05/yes-but-was-it-charged/","title":"Yes but was it charged?","text":"<p>Link: Yes but was it charged?: \"\"</p> <p>Check out Actor Tony Curtis Was Buried With His iPhone(from iPhone Download Blog:</p> <p>\"</p> <p></p> <p>Do you love your iPhone so much that you\u2019d want to take it with you in the grave when you pass away?

This presumably was because Apple felt strategically that they needed to have a strong Java, and that Sun/Oracle would not be providing it, presumably^2 because the OS X installed base was not large enough to justify it. So in summary:</p> <p>Apple previously believed:</p> <ol> <li> <p>OS X can't be credible if it doesn't have a strong Java implementation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sun will think that OS X is not a big enough market to justify the investment.</p> </li> </ol> <p>And now Apple believes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>OS X no longer needs Java for credibility</p> </li> <li> <p>Perhaps the tables are now turned, and Sun/Oracle will need to have OS X to be credible going forward.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Interesting\u2026</p> <p>p.s.

It was my first and probably not my last. Some general thoughts and then a master list of links (the real meat.)</p> <ul> <li>Unlike most all 'business' type conferences and talks I have gone to, the RubyConf style of presentation (and perhaps the Rails or Ruby community -- I don't know where it stops) is beautifully minimalist. Very few words on slides, large and impactful photographs. Is it because no one uses PowerPoint and few even use Keynote? I don't know. But there were no text heavy, bullet heavy word slides. And also, lots and lots of code (that part is definitely a geek thing.)</li> </ul> <p>Here is a loosely organized set of links to the things that hit me most at RubyConf this year. It's random and idiosyncratic (same thing?) but it reflects my real-time notes and feelings. These were all new to me but they might be old news to you, of course.</p> <p>These are my top links:</p> <ul> <li> <p>nicksieger's warbler at master - GitHub - This was one of my top 5 talks. Warbler is a tool to package a Ruby and/or Rails application into a single .jar or .war file to be run on any other computer that has a Java VM installed. If this works as advertised it is a very important bit of technology. I am going to try it out</p> </li> <li> <p>MacRuby: The Definitive Guide - Another one of my favorite talks, about MacRuby, a Mac OS X implementation of Ruby. From what I saw it looks very real, with good integration with all the Mac OS X libraries, and running on top of the Objective C runtime. It wasn't totally clear what Apple's posture is relative to MacRuby, but I hope it is positive.</p> </li> <li> <p>mattmatt's showoff at master - GitHub - Showoff is a very neat presentation tool. It's not an app like Keynote its actually a gem which processes a minimalist markup and serves it up in a local Sinatra server. Also easily lets you deploy your presentation to Heroku. Hmm. Is it mattmatt's or schacon's showoff at master - GitHub???</p> </li> <li> <p>Git Wrangling - This was an intense and complex talk about Git. There is as we know, so much more in Git than most people use, and this talk touched into it. Also, Scott Chacon had a funny (but I think he was serious about it) interlude about how to be a gentleman. It includes the recommendation that a gentleman will always rise when a lady enters the room. Also check out these links with further details about the slides (really, they are good!).</p> </li> <li> <p>Ruby Mendicant University - A really inspiring talk by Greg Brown about his vision and mission to teach people about Ruby and programming. But this is not a fly by night little course, Greg has a big vision and is pursuing this in a comprehensive and highly innovative manner. I was very impressed and will follow and support Greg's work. A great guy!</p> </li> </ul> <p>And here are many more really good ones:</p> <ul> <li> <p>https://github.com/sconover/wrong - And this is the lightening talk that never happened but I saw mentioned in an email. Apparently there was not sufficient time allowed, and some great talks never happened. This one is about a gem called wrong that defines (can you believe it?) yet another way to express expectations (like assert_ and expect_ and etc etc.) But it's really nice and minimalist. I think it's a good addition to the canon!</p> </li> <li> <p>DNS Simple - This looks important to me, and I think I could really use it. Except\u2026 I wish I understood better where DNS Simple fits in my scheme of things. Does it mean that I could ditch GoDaddy as the keeper of my own set of domain names? Would it cost less? Would I be able to cloak my personal name and address like I do with GoDaddy? What are the plusses and minusses? (N.B. See the detailed responses to all these points in the comments)</p> </li> <li> <p>The GO language - I hadn't heard of this language, although it's pretty (really) old after all it's only about 1 year old. Worth looking at for its support of co-routines.</p> </li> <li> <p>http://www.kanbanpad.com/ - A nicely executed very lightweight project planning 'virtual whiteboard', for the new/old Kanban methodology.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ticketmaster - A tool or platform to connect project/ticket tracking systems together. I post to my ticket tracker, and TicketMaster forwards the new ticket to one or more other ticket trackers (e.g. those my client uses.) This is a tricky problem - how do you handle deletes, and do changes to tickets flow both ways? I didn't look how well TicketMaster tries to solve those problems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hipster - A bit of 2010 Culture that I hadn't seen before. Ok. Culture is stretching it.</p> </li> <li> <p>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/163257/macruby_2010.pdf - PDF of the Mac Ruby Presentation</p> </li> <li> <p>Apigee | Free and Enterprise API Management Products and Infrastructure - This is a super cool tool to test and experiment with web apis. Interestingly this comes from the guy who build Swivel.com.</p> </li> <li> <p>rabbit | RubyGems.org | your community gem host - Another presentation tool, analogous to showoff.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stop procrastination: Introducing the noprocrast gem - rfw.posterous.com - Proof that I am not the only one that gets distracted while working. Here a fellow designed a little utility to cut him off from the net while he is trying to focus. This is called self-binding. Check out this other article which I have pointed to before about the concept of self-binding (it's not as kinky as it sounds.)</p> </li> <li> <p>RubyConf 2010 | SpeakerRate - We are a community who loves building tools. Here's a tool that lets listeners at any conference rate speakers. Very cool building block.</p> </li> <li> <p>http://blog.danieljackoway.com/rubyconf-2010.html - Daniel presented about Ruboto, a tool allowing us to write Android applications in Ruby. One nice thing that Jack covers, and I saw this in many of the presentation, is a forthright summary of other tools and solutions that one might consider in addition to Ruboto.</p> </li> <li> <p>Redcar - An all-ruby programmers editor -- TextMate written in Ruby. This was a very popular talk and it generated a lot of conversation. It is a work in progress but is very promising. The demonstrations of writing custom commands in Ruby on the fly were impressive. For me personally, I still prefer a full IDE especially one with a visual debugger. I am actually surprised that Rubyists as far as I can tell don't use an interactive debugger (see this survey)</p> </li> <li> <p>http://tmm1.net/debugging-ruby-systems.pdf - A really good presentation. This pdf (after a bunch of photos at the beginning) is chock full of specific utilities and techniques for advanced profiling and analysis of your ruby and Rails code.</p> </li> <li> <p>ZOMG WHY IS THIS CODE SO SLOW - A presentation that unfortunately I missed, but so good that the slides stand on their own. Lots of specific tips around Rails and Ruby Performance</p> </li> <li> <p>bfts's minitest-2.0.0 Documentation - A small replacement for Test::Unit. I thought I heard that it was part of Ruby 1.9, but I might have misunderstood.</p> </li> <li> <p>tmm1's perftools.rb at master - GitHub - An interesting package of performance tools on Git</p> </li> <li> <p>MIRAH - An interesting little language, it looks like Ruby (but it's NOT Ruby). It is statically typed and compiles directly into efficient JVM byte code.</p> </li> <li> <p>schacon's grit at master - GitHub - One of several gems to access Git and Github functionality from Ruby</p> </li> <li> <p>libgit2's ribbit at master - GitHub Another one of several gems to access Git and Github functionality from Ruby</p> </li> <li> <p>BusyConf - Making Great Conferences Even Better - A promising service for conferences. From what you can see so far, there will be a nice and detailed conference schedule. But I can imagine many additional bits of functionality.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rc2010 refinements - A presentation by Shugo Maeda, close confidant of Matz and a Ruby Committer. The presentation contemplates some rather exotic additions to the Ruby language to overcome some problems that are encountered by large systems built in Ruby. Coyly described as features that might be in Ruby 2.0, which is on an unknown schedule.</p> </li> <li> <p>RabbitMQ - Messaging that just works - A highly touted message queueing platform, usable with Ruby and Rails and other systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>collectiveidea's delayed_job at master - GitHub - Delayed job is a popular Ruby based background job product.</p> </li> <li> <p>markbates's dj_remixes at master - GitHub - Mark Bates adds some great additional functionality to Delayed Job</p> </li> <li> <p>slagyr's solari at master - GitHub - A very cute Raffling applications used when you have to raffle something to a big crowd. Very cute, looks great, sound effects and so on.</p> </li> <li> <p>robey's kestrel at master - GitHub - Kestrel is the follow on to Starling, which is a message queueing platform, originally from Twitter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Home \u2014 JRuby.org - JRuby is JRuby. I haven't tried it yet. But my sense is that it's definitely worth using in many situations. You can access the huge collection of Java libraries, and, because of the highly optimized JVM, you often will have better performance than MRI (the original and still default Ruby VM)</p> </li> <li> <p>Rails Talk Ruby CSS Parser - I was thinking back to some of my own projects, and one is to create a CSS simplifier/optimizer. Here's a Ruby based CSS parser.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["code","rails","ruby","rubycon-tagf"]},{"location":"2010/11/17/easily-the-best-microsoft-advertisement/","title":"Easily the best Microsoft advertisement EVER","text":"<p>Link: Easily the best Microsoft advertisement EVER: \"\"</p> <p>And, maybe, better than any ad that Apple has ever done\u2026.</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAhJTxC1C8w&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0]</p>","tags":["advertisement","apple","microsoft"]},{"location":"2010/11/18/woz-speaks-on-iphone/","title":"Woz speaks (on iPhone)","text":"<p>Link: Woz speaks (on iPhone): \"\"</p> <p>I happen to be reading iWoz, which is Steve Wozniak's memoir/biography/whatever.

You have to agree that it has yielded some interesting insights about the way the world works.</p> <p>First of all: as far as a diplomat making snide comments about one world leader or another, big deal! I mean it's embarrassing (like someone hacking your email account or finding your personal diary) but certainly no one is surprised -- gossiping and show boating is human nature, yes?</p> <p>A friend of mine who has been in the foreign service for a long time read the cables with gusto and said if nothing else, it shows that the US foreign service officials are smart and thoughtful and do an impressive and important job.</p> <p>From that perspective he feels pride that the work that he's done in obscurity for years finally gets seen by his friends and colleagues who can now appreciate it for what it is.</p> <p>Here are some more serious questions that occur to me:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If it is illegal for Wikileaks to publish cables that they received (from essentially a whistleblower in the Defense department) then why is it not equally illegal for the New York Times to publish them? Is it because the NYT is 'more reasonable' and will more likely do what the government wants them to do?</p> </li> <li> <p>Think about having a thumb drive with 500,000 documents on it. What do you do with it? What's the point of making it available, even to someone with a 'need to know'? How do you make sense of it. Talk about trying to find a needle in a haystack. Chances are good that you won't. It brings up the importance of tools and systems to process, classify, summarize and in general make sense of it.</p> </li> <li> <p>This leak appears to have been the work of a lone whistleblower. How is it even possible that a single person has access to such a huge collection of documents? Given the size of thumb drives (I just bought a 16Gig drive for under $30) keeping them from moving in and out of secure buildings is impossible. So the problem is access to the data, and ability to 'export it' at all.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Some final links if you are still with me.

Public sector unions face managers who have an incentive to give into them for the sake of their own survival. Most important, public sector unions help choose those they negotiate with. Through gigantic campaign contributions and overall clout, they have enormous influence over who gets elected to bargain with them, especially in state and local races.</p> <p>As a result of these imbalanced incentive structures , states with public sector unions tend to run into fiscal crises.

It is way to allow a donor to donate to one or more causes that match certain objectives. Please read on\u2026]</p> <p>Scenario : What if I wanted to make a charitable gift to reputable non profits, who work in my state, who focus on homelessness? I could research it with various services (such as GuideStar) I might see one or two that speak to me, and decide to write a check or two. Now of course they would come back to me a year later (or sooner) to ask for another donation, and maybe I would or maybe I'd like to pick a different one.</p> <p>So here's an idea that (literally) came to me in a dream. I don't remember the story line but this idea stuck with me.</p> <p>What if there was an organization (itself a non-profit) that automated this and did this for me. In other words, I would fill out a form describing the kind of work I wanted to support:</p> <p></p> <p>With that information I sent in a check for say $1,000.00. They would immediately apportion that check according to my specification and make one or more donations on my behalf. If I wanted to do this say annually, they would could manage that as well.</p> <p>I call this a \"Charitable Mutual Fund \" because, like a mutual fund, a entrust a third party to 'invest' my funds according to a certain guideline that I give it. And I empower them to adjust the donations based on their judgement of the individual causes.</p> <p>Now the term \"Mutual Fund\" could be very misleading and therefore might be totally wrong. It implies investment and appreciation. What I am describing here is not an investment vehicle at all and would actually not hold on to any funds at all, nor would it have any returns for donors.</p> <p>Charitable Mutual Funds could either be \"actively managed \", where a presumably smart board of advisors would determine the best and most deserving charities that matched my particular focus, or they could operate like an \"index fund \" where an algorithm would simply grab the 10 or 50 highest rated charities and distribute donated funds pro-rata.</p> <p>Does this already exist? I did a quick web search and saw no evidence of it but it strikes me as something that easily could have been created before. At any rate, I am in no position to implement this myself. I also think it would be non-trivial to build with challenging legal, tax, confidence and marketing issues to figure out.

You always read, make sure you've looked into whatever cause you want to support to make sure it is what you are looking for. Follow what they are doing. Get to know them. The model I describe flies in the face of that.</p> <p>Now of course the same could be (and was) said about stock mutual funds. Only invest in companies you really know, don't just copy someone else's investment ideas. But of course we learned that there is a very real role for stock mutual funds.</p> <p>A second response would be that our service would have an option where you received a quarterly update indicating what charities were supported by your donations, what they have done, and so on. Or you could even have a chance to approve a change in the roster of charities that your donation would be going to.</p> <p>So there are good ways to overcome this objection.</p>","tags":["charity","giving","guidestar"]},{"location":"2011/03/14/fareed-zakaria-are-americas-best/","title":"Fareed Zakaria: \u201cAre Americas Best Days Behind Us\u201d?","text":"<p>Link: Fareed Zakaria: \u201cAre Americas Best Days Behind Us\u201d?: \"\"</p> <p>I know it's a provocative title , and sadly I suspect that many of the 'intended audience' will agree with much of what he says, but then also feel like there's nothing that can be done about it.</p> <p>I am a waning fan of the Sunday TV news shows.

The key to understanding the moves by both parties is that, for the most part, they are targeting programs that have neither a wide base of support nor influential interest groups behind them. (And that's precisely why they're not where the money is. The American political system is actually quite efficient. It distributes the big bucks to popular programs and powerful special interests.)</p> <p>And neither side will even talk about tax increases, though it is impossible to achieve long-term fiscal stability without them.

If a commentator says \u2014 correctly \u2014 that social mobility from one generation to the next is greater in many European nations than in the U.S., he is laughed at.</p> <p>Yet several studies, the most recent from the OECD last year, have found that the average American has a much lower chance of moving out of his parents' income bracket than do people in places like Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Canada.

There are no tests. However, many argue that grading itself is not a useful tool. If the student is motivated and works hard they learn, and if not they don't. After all, in the real world you don't have tests and you don't get grades, right?</p> <p>I kind of agree with that. For me, grading is not about the final grade, when all is said and done.

The idea he mentions I believe came from a Professor Lee Sheldon. Here's the link to his course, Gaming the Classroom.</p> <p>In my teaching at Brandeis, deciding how to handle grading is one of thetrickier problems to solve. While my experience teaching so far is quite limited I have come to believe you need to be aware that your students' expectations about what 'counts' towards the grade will heavily influence their behavior.</p> <p>Whether you like it our not that which they feel will help their gradethey will do more of and less of the latter. Yeah I would say that they are sincerely there to learn and do their best given all the circumstances. But it's human nature: when it's 2am and they need to decide whether to tackle the final homework, go to sleep or go to a party, you can bet that somewhere in the back of their mind is the impact they believe it will have on the grade.</p> <p>So, what might this new scheme look like?</p> <ul> <li> <p>All activities that occur during the term can potentially gain a student experience points. Start simple: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Show up on time: 1 point</p> </li> <li> <p>Show up on time for a week stretch: 5 points</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask a question: 1 point</p> </li> <li> <p>Answer a question: 1 point</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Homeworks can give you points too: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Hand in your homework on time: 3 points. down to 2, 1 and 0 if it's late by 1, 2 or 3 days</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality of the homework can gain you between 0 and 10 points</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Let's say that your course has an element of team work </p> <ul> <li> <p>Every week, each member of a team gets 5 points that they can award to one or more teammates for contributing to the project</p> </li> <li> <p>For every team delivery that's on time, each member of the team gets 2 points</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Each student's total points is posted electronically every day on a leader board</p> </li> <li> <p>A student or a team can 'level up' by making a certain number of points</p> </li> <li> <p>Each level comes with certain privileges</p> </li> <li> <p>And at the end of the term, your 'grade' is a simple, predefined formula based on your points</p> </li> </ul> <p>How is this different from what I did before?</p> <ul> <li> <p>It's more granular. Each small event becomes converted into a standardized fungible unit, a point</p> </li> <li> <p>It's granular chronologically too. You know day to day how you are scoring</p> </li> <li> <p>It's more fun and introduces an element of competition, prestige and pride into the experience</p> </li> <li> <p>It's public yet doesn't reveal too much.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It does have problems though:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The student who is not doing well is publicly exposed. This is probably a bad idea, and, it might even be unethical or illegal.</p> </li> <li> <p>You need to be very careful about how you set up the points because, referring back to my original point, it will modify behavior and you will 'get exactly what you are paying for' which might not actually be what you want.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Anyway, it was an inspired idea.

I have almost totally stopped downloading MP3s and am gradually locating all my favorite music on Spotify.

I find that I am using Spotify on my iPhone and on my computer, all the time. Occasionally I will dip back into my large iTunes collection to remind me of artists that I want to listen to. But I promptly go onto Spotify, and search for the artist and grab all their albums not just the one or two I had in iTunes.</p> <p>It turns out that for me, not 'owning' the mp3s is not a big deal at all. I am almost always online when I am playing music, either on a computer or an iPhone. And when I am not actually online (on a plane for example) it is easy to make selected play lists available on my iPhone as long as I thought of it ahead of time.</p> <p>Comparing it to Rhapsody, they are very similar services. They cost the same and seem to have similar sized catalogs. At least, most of the music I want I can find on either one. Still somehow I found that I am using Spotify much more often than I used Rhapsody. Rhapsody does not have a 'real' mac application so you have to have it running in a browser window which can be a nuisance. Also the Spotify UI experience is a little more streamlined (although it misses some really important features that Rhapsody has.)</p> <p>Comparing it to Pandora, the clear difference is that on Spotify you can play the specific album and/or track you want, over and over again if you want. On Pandora you can just ask for music that 'sounds like' another track. And while it does a decent job, you often want to listen specifically to Madeleine Peyroux and no one else.</p> <p>Comparing it to iTunes, the clear difference is that I don't own any music. And if tomorrow Spotify goes out of business or I decide to stop subscribing, my whole 'collection' disappears. What I own is the list of music that I like, and presumably I would be able to move the list over to the next service. Also I am constantly discovering new music and so my iTunes collection has lots of stuff that I don't listen to anymore. On the other hand, lots of stuff, like NPR interviews, Technical podcasts, lecture series and other material is only available as mp3 and so I will keep using iTunes for that, I am sure.</p> <p>What about the new integration with Facebook? Not sure yet. What music I listen to is no secret. But it is a little weird that people in my network can watch my listening habits, play by play as it were, and I listen to a lot of music. As soon as I wake up the music goes on.</p> <p>Anyway, all in all, Spotify is great and is now my primary music service.</p>","tags":["itunes","pandora","spotify"]},{"location":"2011/10/04/nation-building/","title":"Nation Building","text":"<p>Link: Nation Building: \"\"</p> <p>Here's a topic I have never written about before\u2026 Nation Building.

Here's a succinct tutorial on buying a telescope that my friend Ben Gomes Casseres emailed me which I thought might be of general interest. You can see Ben's own astronomy work here.</p> <p>If you are thinking of buying a telescope (or giving one as a gift), Ben says:</p> <p>The place to go to browse is www.oriontelescopes.com. They have advice on entry-level telescopes and such. Have Dick review what is available there and then let me know\u2026.I can help select among options. I am not sure what you can get for 500-1000, as there is a tendency for them to sell things for kids that are very cheap that are not worth it (poor optics, or flimsy mount, or just over-promising.)</p> <p>As a general rule: Don't skimp on the mount (heavy is good) or on the size of the \"objective\" (essentially the \"width of the tube\"\u2026no less than 3\" if a \"refractor\" type and no less than 6\u2033 if a \"reflector\" type). At the same time, make it something easy to set up and take out of the box, or else it won't be used. Don't be fooled by \"power\" as most observing is done at 50x to 150x and anything higher is usually wasted. Leave some funds for books and atlas to help find things and see what is interesting to observe on a given night; and perhaps a subscription to \"Sky and Telescope\" (the standard in amateur astronomy) or \"Astronomy\" (more basic). The sites for these mags also have reviews that may be helpful.</p> <p>You may find that a 3\u2033 refractor (has a lens in front) on a nice mount might work; some are shorter than others (more $$) and offer wider fields of view. Or a \"catadioptric\" (lens in front + mirror in back and the optical path is folded on itself and so compressed in size) in the range of 6-8\u2033. The most popular for many people is a 8\u2033 Meade or Celestron catadioptric, which comes with mount and everything, but it is over 1k I would think. But check those out, as they are pretty good as one-size-fits-all instruments. Many other instruments are best for planets and moon but not for star fields and nebulas, or best for the latter but not the former.</p> <p>A great pair of binoculars (7\u00d750), such as Fujinon or other high quality, is also very nice and may be a good way to start. There are books on \"roaming the sky with binoculars\" (see Sky and Tel website) and in dark skies you can see a lot of wide-angle stuff.

Written from a Conservative's viewpoint it critiques some of the pillars of American Conservatism that might not be effective or useful anymore.</p> <p>The part I found the most interesting is the argument against the popular Starve The Beast concept in our current political discourse. As I understand it (a big caveat) the Starve The Beast idea is that the only way to shrink the size of government is by cutting budgets severely. Because, while everyone agrees that government is too big (!) congress does not have the will to shrink it by eliminating parts of it.</p> <p>So instead, do it indirectly, so that the cause and effect are separated enough and it will get through. You cut budgets in a macro way today, meaning, budget caps, tax cuts , and so on -- don't go into too much detail about the specific stuff you are cutting. And then, tomorrow, the impact of the cuts are noticed but it's too late because the dies are cast and the beast shrinks or dies.</p> <p>The problem with this is that we (the people and the leadership) like the benefits of big government so much that we revert to deficit spending despite the macro cuts. See for example the unfunded Iraq war that was explicitly kept 'off the books '. And so the beast doesn't starve, the bill is just passed on to future generations.</p> <p>The Serve The Check concept says, make sure that everything the government does shows up on our tax bills. I think this implies actually raising taxes. Maybe break them out into bits that can be identified: this line goes to the military , this line goes to health care and so on. Now we can see in painful detail on our tax returns what our taxes will be and we, the electorate, will insist on shrinking government.</p> <p>\"Long-term evidence indicates that the starve-the-beast strategy not only fails, but may make the problem of unrestrained spending growth worse, suggesting that a \"serve the check\" strategy might be a more effective means of curbing the growth of government spending.</p> <p>The simple explanation for this seeming paradox is that the starve-the-beast strategy currently allows Americans to receive a dollar in government services while only having to pay 60 cents for it.3 Rigorous analyses from centrist economists Christina and David Romer of UC Berkeley4, and from libertarian economist (and Reagan White House alumnus) William Niskanen conclude that the starve-the-beast strategy fails.</p> <p>Strikingly, Niskanen's analysis found that lower taxes correlated with higher levels of federal spending. As a result, Niskanen argues that raising taxes may be the most effective way to reduce gov-ernment spending.\" (from Modernizing Conservatism)</p> <p>Ok I am going on and on.

It is important that we become aware of the limitations of current methods and develop alternative ways to improve the accuracy of election results.\"' (from Rice University)</p> <p>The bottom line result that they found was that \"Hand counting of votes in post election audit or recount procedures can result in error rates of up to 2 percent.\" You can easily recall recent elections that were decided by less than 2 percent, right?</p> <p>Bruce Schneier (a highly respected cryptography and security expert) says:</p> <p>\"All voting systems have nonzero error rates. This doesn't surprise technologists, but does surprise the general public. There's a myth out there that elections are perfectly accurate, down to the single vote. They're not. If the vote is within a few percentage points, they're likely a statistical tie. (The problem, of course, is that elections must produce a single winner.)\" (see Bruce Schneier's Blog)</p>","tags":["ballots","counting","election-tags","handcounting","voting"]},{"location":"2012/02/10/selling-course-notes-a-market/","title":"Selling course notes: a market solution","text":"<p>Link: Selling course notes: a market solution: \"\"</p> <p>Should it be ok for students to take notes during a class and turn them into a marketable product that they make money on?</p> <p>If I am teaching the same class again this year, students could buy the course notes and potentially do better, or learn more.

The differences were striking: students who walked freely were better at generating creative uses for the objects \u00e2\u0080\u0094 coming up with over 25 percent more original ideas.

Based on what I like to do, where I am, whether I have a car or not, this app helps me construct an plan of where to go and what to do. Like all of these apps, the key is in how good their content is and so far, all they have is, predictably, San Fransisco. So a promising but incomplete idea.</p> <p>SongSpin and Anthem : Two interesting music applications. SongSpin makes a music discovery service. Songspin produces a 'curated' collection of music by genre and delivers it as a 'radio station' that you can listen to while online. There are many services that do this but it's a pretty nice of execution. Anthm is an app that lets a bunch of people (at a party for example) can collaboratively control a play list. The music is playing on a computer running Spotify or a similar app.</p> <p>License123 - Mundane but powerful. Based on State, City and type of business, this app will tell me what permits and licenses I would need to start such a business in that place. Supposedly this is a tricky and slow (not to mention costly) process. I guess the use of this app is episodic. I only need it when I am planning to open a new business. Still very cool!</p> <p>15Five - Supposedly similar to Yammer according to the judges. This is a way to gather and respond to status reports semi automatically. Looks very slick. Depends on the price, because standard emails would work here too. But nicely executed.</p> <p>Happiily.com - A more conventional employee survey tool. Nicely done. I didn't catch whether they randomly survey a particular subset of employees so that any particular employee doesn't get polled too often. Nice survey tool with nice reporting.</p> <p>Hunuku.com - Make it possible or easier to learn about the family stories and history. You have to get over the normal awkwardness in asking your mother what your father was like as a young man. Or why uncle Foo doesn't get along with Aunt Bar. I will try it in my family to see if it works.</p> <p>Meetcute.com - Based on the appearances match people up for anonymous rendezvous in local coffee shops and hangouts. The judges don't like it, but on the other hand they are all 'old' and 'married'. So basically a user gets to review a bunch of pictures of 'actors' and rate if they are 'cute' or 'not'.</p> <p>Based on this two users are sent to a location without knowing who the other person is or whether they have arrived yet.

Anticipated challenges are: text in javascript; right to left languages; text embedded in images.</p> <p>TrustEgg - Easily create a trust account for your children and make it really easy to add money to it for them, and have other family members contribute to the fund. The money is invested in a index fund or perhaps other choices. I see an analogy with a Charitable Gift Fund where a big trust is built and allows parents to set up a trust fund in a very light weight way and without having to set up a trust yourself. Also it makes it easy to have others (grandparents, uncles, aunts) add funds to it.</p> <p>Offlane - Flipboard with offline capabilities. Even, tweeting while offline. Even searching offline. Even ordering premium content offline. Will be free to download, with a $5 a month to get the service.</p> <p>Minbox - A new way to access my email designed for non-techies. Very light weight, and oriented around people rather than messages. It's a light layer over gmail. It might be useful for people who get overrun with non-people emails that clutter up their inbox and are a source of annoyance.</p> <p>AppStack - Magically builds a mobile app by scaling the web for your business phone number, It might work well in the demo but how well will it work across an arbitrary business?</p> <p>Couplestreet - Facebook for just two. Not sure.</p> <p>GonnaBe - Where I am gonna be. Helps people share what they plan to do to get others to come along. This sounds just like Plancast. They claim that Plancast was not as mobile and that Plancast tried to publicize longer term plans. GonnaBe is focused much more short term. Today, tomorrow, maybe next week, but that's it.</p> <p>Captricity - Given a pile of paper forms this product does flexible form data extraction. User describes what the fields are in a form and then extract the data and returning a database with the extracted data. Demoer says that they 'build a custom oct engine on the side' to actually process the forms.</p> <p>Snaptat - First of a series of apps built, essentially, around a Instagram tag. Snaptat is the first, and it appears as a special purpose Instagram for Tattoo artists. They can create other vacations, for example for pets, dogs, and so on. They believe they can do another app every 6-8 weeks for around $10,000.00.</p> <p>Fantasy Politics - A fantasy sports game built around politics! Baseball cards for politicians. They create a \"power score\" for a politician. Kind of 'clout' for politicians, from 0-99. Sounds cool but I can't find their site.</p> <p>Upto - Lets me share events from my calendar with other people that I care about.

I am not going into the best salutation or the best conclusion but more touchy-feely things. Here are my guidelines:</p> <ol> <li>Write the email as if it might show up on the front page of the paper tomorrow morning. Because it might. Or it might be forwarded to the wrong person. Or you may accidentally send it to the wrong person. Worse, to a long mailing list of the wrong people. Don't include anything that you would be embarrassed or worse, ashamed, to have to explain.</li> <li>Realize that the other person may not have the same email habits as you. They may only check emails once a day. Or they might receive 200 messages per day and habitually not answer many of them. They might even have a hard time typing (yes there are some.) So don't be offended when you don't get a response when you think you should have gotten one.</li> <li>Keep it short. People skim and scan. Don't tell your life's story. Focus on what the outcome is that you would like of the email you sent and indicate that up front. Or if you don't expect an answer, then sometimes it is helpful to say that too (\"No response is necessary\") Write your email like an article in USA Today. Start with the most important thing and go from there. And make it short.</li> <li>Remember that you can call or talk face to face. For most delicate, personal or heavy topics, it is often better to talk. This is self evident and yet I often see people who should know better opting for an email and getting into major fights, misunderstandings or hurt. And even if you go down the email route and things seem to be spinning out of control, remember you can still help by switching to a phone call or face to face conversation.</li> <li>Be careful about public forums, mailing list and Facebook. Remind yourself about all the people seeing your sarcastic comment or ironic statement or personal attack. Without the context and the relationship who knows what impression they get. </li> </ol> <p>These guidelines may or may not apply for you. I learned them through personal experience and have the scars to prove it!</p>","tags":["email","ettiquette","guidelines","rooky"]},{"location":"2012/04/06/americans-elect-another-opinion/","title":"Americans Elect: Another Opinion","text":"<p>Link: Americans Elect: Another Opinion: \"\"</p> <p>A month or two ago I read an article by Thomas Friedman introducing Americans Elect, an innovative concept for bringing a third major presidential candidate to the table for this year's Presidential contest.

This morning I was preparing lecture notes for \"Current Issues In Social Networks\". Here are some good current links I have been able to find:</p> <ul> <li>Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?</li> <li>Social Media's Small Positive Role in Human Relationships</li> <li>Diane Rehm's Program about Social Media and Loneliness</li> <li>The Flight from Conversation</li> </ul> <p>I have just come from a family reunion where there were people pulling out iPhones at 'inappropriate times' and other people debating what has happened to the art of conversation now that we are all Facebooking all the time. (Guilty as charged!)</p> <p>So between the two I have spent some time thinking about this phenomenon and whether social networks and mobile phones together are a new kind of addictive behavior which is doing real damage to social interactions (that is, human to human, face to face.)</p> <p>Or on the other hand, are they just an evolution of interaction and communication and anyone who doesn't see it as an equally valid way of interacting must be a fuddy duddy. Good question! And I don't really know the answer, not even what I myself think about it.</p> <p>But this article by Zaynep Tufekci contains what for me is a profound insight or claim:</p> <p>\"Finally, I've previously argued that some people may be \"cyberasocial,\" that is, they are unable or unwilling to invoke a sense of social presence through mediated communication, somewhat similar to the way we invoke language -- a fundamentally oral form -- through reading, which is a hack in our brain. I suspect such people may well be at a major disadvantage similar to the way people who could not or would not talk on the telephone would be in late 20th century.\" (from Social Media's Small Positive Role in Human Relationships)</p> <p>In other words, I can imagine that when writing was 'invented' and more importantly I suppose, when writing was becoming accessible to everyone, that there were those who were bemoaning the loss of story telling and oral history.</p> <p>I can imagine that when the telephone started becoming popular (as indicated in the quote above) there were those bemoaning that we no longer had to visit together by the fireplace but could just make a phone call.</p> <p>I myself can remember people who refused to have an answering machine because they wanted to talk, or refused to leave a message because it was too impersonal.</p> <p>But none of those foretold the end of civilization. They were evolutions which enriched and eventually became a commonplace aspect of the way we interact.</p> <p>I think that 's a great insight: that being in community or sharing relationships through social media - to our Facebook friends or mailing lists or twitter or even sharing photos in Instagram may seem to be taking time away from our spending 'quality time' together.</p> <p>But perhaps it's just the next evolution of sharing and relationships - not to displace what came before but adding a new dimension and a new valuable dimension to inter-personal relationships.</p>","tags":["brandeis","communication-tag","evolution-tag","face-to-face","facebook","interaction-tag","social-networks","twitter"]},{"location":"2012/05/16/mark-twain-all-ideas-are/","title":"Mark Twain: All Ideas are Second-Hand","text":"<p>Link: Mark Twain: All Ideas are Second-Hand: \"\"</p> <p>I have often been heard to say: \"Ideas are Cheap\", by which I mean to say that my admiration goes more with the implementation, the making real and tangible, of an idea than the idea itself.

If you are interested in elections and voting and how they can and cannot be bought, you might find this intriguing. By the way, this scheme would never work in the US as we have many mechanisms that would prevent that, but these might apply in other countries that are not as sophisticated.</p> <p>Scenario:</p> <p>Say a bad guy made an offer secretly to the population that he would give each voter $100 for a vote cast for himself. Say they are using optical scan ballots. Say that cell phone cameras are easily snuck into the polling booth.</p> <p>If you were the bad guy, what proof would you ask for so that people couldn't trick you and collect lots of $100 for votes that they really didn't cast. And if you were the government or an activist, what would you tell people about how to trick the bad guy and collect a bunch of $100 bills?:</p> <p>Here's the analysis:</p> <p>Before the Australian ballot, it was easy! Anybody can print a ballot, lots of straight party ballots printed. You go to your party boss in your polling place, he gives you a ballot, you put in the box, simple. When the party bosses were excluded, well, you had to get your ballot from him, and minions could observe you not getting a different. With some slight of hand you could trick them, but still very effective b/c most people won't attempt the slight of hand under threat of kneecapping. The almost as soon as Australian ballot was adopted (you might get a blank ballot from a government official in the polling place and mark it in the polling place), chain voting was invented.</p> <p>Now, today, chain voting is too pesky and low throughput, how about we use the voter's digital camera in the polling booth! The can take a picture of the ballot that they marked as instructed by the boss. You show the boss a picture on your camera, he gives you money and/or spares your kneecaps. But wait! The digital photo can be faked? Hmmm.</p> <p>I think that is the stage you've set. There are two main questions. What methods can the boss put in place to increase the difficulty of faked photos? What measures can election officials take to make it more difficult for real photos to be produced?</p> <p>A separate question, new to me: if you were the government or an activist, what would you tell people about how to trick the bad guy and collect a bunch of $100 bills? You bear in mind that it is not just money. The deal might be this: you show me you voted right and I'll give you money; you don't show me, and my goons bust your kneecaps.</p> <p>Well, if I were the gov't, I would be forbidding the use of cameras or cellphones or any kind of recording device in polling places, rather than telling people it is OK. Allowing recording devices in the voting booth is creating the opportunity for vote intimidation. You never want that.</p> <p>So let me go back to the two main questions. I would suggest to election officials that ballot marking be done in three sided carrels made of translucent plastic that will mask a view of the ballot being marked, but allow a view of the use of recording devices.</p> <p>There would need to be lots of training both of voters -- we really don't want you to using recording devices! -- and poll workers to intervene by asking a voter to please mark a ballot again, because this one you marked and then did some weird stuff in the carrel that looked like taking a photo.</p> <p>The boss has a harder time. Clearly a photo of a properly marked ballot won't do, b/c anybody can make one of those. The photo would need to include something that showed the ballot and me, together. So probably it should include my hand as something that should be unique and distinguishing. Maybe the boss could stamp my wrist with a unique number, in ink that takes days to wear off. Even so, I could prepare a photo combining a properly marked ballot, and my hand, but not the ballot that I cast! If pre-printed ballots are freely available, then I can prepare a photo that the boss expects, but still vote a real secret ballot in the polling place. I could even make a fake picture in the voting booth, using a pre-made ballot, but then marking a real blank ballot and casting that. From there you are in a spy vs spy sort of games with more boss requirements on the photo, making it more difficult to fake, but also more difficult get away with in the real voting booth.</p>","tags":["election-tags","vote-buying","votes","voting"]},{"location":"2012/10/15/a-travesty-in-a-wealthy/","title":"A travesty in a wealthy country","text":"<p>Link: A travesty in a wealthy country: \"\"</p> <p>From the New York Times, an article by Nick Kristof, describing a real-life story of a friend of his and health care.</p> <p>Whenever I hear, \"We have the best health care in the world\", I think of stories like this.

At least in the world of software engineering and product development, everyone and their grandfather have ideas that may be great. The distance between the idea and the reality is great. Here's Steve Jobs about ideas</p> </li> <li> <p>When your project is late,never ADD people Most of the time this will slow you down. The reason is that with each additional person you add to a project you've created that many more paths of communication. If a project is late, adding people to it will make it later. See * The Mythical Man Month by Fred Brooks.</p> </li> <li> <p>When planning your time,always allocate at least 20% to learning more Software engineering, programming languages, libraries, platforms, hardware and software are constantly changing. It take a real sustained effort to keep yourself up to date. What was a good or best practice a year ago may no longer be right.</p> </li> <li> <p>When arguing about a design or a feature,always stop and go ask a user. Good products don't come from debate around a table, they come from discussion with the actual users. Don't guess, don't argue, go ask! This is known as \"getting out of the building\".</p> </li> <li> <p>When planning a project,always work in short increments. Follow Agile practices, whatever your favorite flavor is, scrum, XP, Kanban, it doesn't matter. Different teams and people like different approaches. And they change and evolve all the time. But there are eternal truths there. Work in small chunks. Even smaller. Even smaller. Don't change many things at once because when your code invariably breaks, you won't be able to tell why.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you are spinning your wheels,always stop, think, and only then act. Google It! The amount of knowledge and down and dirty solutions that you can find on google is infinite. See a strange error message? Google it! And learn how to edit the error message, removing the parts that are specific to you so that you get matches. Or ask on the right forum or mailing list. You need to learn how to ask a question in a way that it will be answered. Make it as easy as possible on the answerer. </p> </li> <li> <p>When you are posting on a technical forum,always formulate the question carefully. Here are the best practices:</p> <ul> <li>Explain precisely what you are trying to accomplish</li> <li>Give a step by step explanation of what you've tried and the result.</li> <li>Give code samples, links to github accounts, and so on. If the code samples are not brief, create a gist and put the link in the post.</li> <li>Include listings of the relevant data, file names, console logs, and versions of various software you use.</li> <li> <p>When you are writing a 'business' email, always follow best-practices</p> </li> <li> <p>If you expect action, have a single person in the to:</p> </li> <li>Know the difference between reply and reply all. Usually don't reply all</li> <li>The first sentence should state what action you are looking for</li> <li>Keep it short and sweet. Make it \"skimmable\". </li> <li>Know your audience and write appropriately. </li> <li>Get to the point. Be polite. </li> <li>When you have to write up a design or a spec,always keep it to a few pages. Prefer writing short 'stories' over writing long 'specifications. There is no requirements 'phase' to a project any more. Write many short stories and prioritize them relentlessly. If the story is more effort to write than the code, you should be writing the code!.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["engineering","rules","software"]},{"location":"2014/04/12/rules-of-thumb-for-software/#programming-rules-of-thumb","title":"Programming Rules of Thumb","text":"<ol> <li> <p>When coding,never go beyond the immediate requirement. Write only the code you need to solve the problem RIGHT now. You might think that this class clearly will need all this methods even though no one is calling them yet. This almost never works out. Don't spend time to set things up for what you'll need in a month. You're usually wrong.</p> </li> <li> <p>When coding,always wait to optimize until later. Optimizing too early is one of the cardinal sins of programming. You never know where the bottleneck will be, The thing you think will be slow, will be fast, and vice-versa. Actually you might end up ripping it out anyway!</p> </li> <li> <p>When your own code mystifies or surprises you never accept that. Dig deeper.</p> <ul> <li>Catch yourself engaging in magical thinking. If it worked yesterday, and not today, then something changed. Similar story as \"It worked on my machine, why doestn't it work in production?\" Both of these are a symptom of magical engineering thinking. It's just a computer. If the behavior changed, then something cause that change in the behavior. Methodically go through each thing that might be different and, like a scientist (or Sherlock) figure out what it was.</li> <li>Don 't be satisfied with blind luck Copying some code without knowing what is going on is not a good idea. Eventually it will come back to haunt you. Be really curious!. If a certain change fixed the problem, investigate until you understand how it fixed the problem.</li> <li>Learn to Debug Debugging is a craft in itself. Approach it like a scientist. Don't poke blindly at the code, or solve the problem just by thinking about it. Have hypotheses to test. Do experiments.</li> <li>When your program blows up always stop and read the error messages. Catch yourself jumpint to conclusions or seeing what's not there. Fight the impulse that you know what must have failed. Often the right answer is right there in the error message. It might be buried in the middle of a lot of noisy trace output, but discipline yourself to actually read it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If you think you spot a code smell always come back and eradicate it Train yourself to recognize (and HATE) code smells. Like nails on a blackboard, badly designed code should make your stomach turn or your skin crawl.</p> <ul> <li>&lt;%= ir \"Never, Ever\" %&gt; Cut and Paste code. DRY is a law. If you see any duplicated code it is almost always a bad thing. Look for it and kill it.</li> <li>&lt;%= ir \"Learn how to Refactor\" %&gt; This is a fundamental coding skill. When you see non-dry code or other violations, refactor ruthlessly.</li> <li>never leave dead code behind** Delete it.</li> <li>always keep your files, methods and functions short** Depending on the language and the program, the right number may vary. But a method that has more than 20 lines is almost always a serious code smell. A guideline would be 10 lines.</li> <li>When programming always use a source control system. It's your safety net. This is especially true when working with other programmers. Learn your SCS tool so you are never reluctant to use it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When designing software,always keep concerns as separate as possible. Design for loose coupling. Pay attention to the Single Responsibility principle. Whether it's a single class or function, a subsystem or module, or a whole system, minimize dependencies. Learn about dependency injection and other techniques for decoupling.</p> </li> <li> <p>When doing object oriented programming always avoid using class inheritence While tempting, it is almost always better to avoid using inheritence in your class design. It brings undesireable coupling with little benefit that could be had in a simpler way.</p> </li> <li> <p>When programming always use 'intention revealing names' Chosing the right names for classes, variables, methods is one of the best ways to 'document' your code. Follow your language's naming conventions closely and then create names that reveal your intention. Name things after what they do, not after how they work! Also make sure names are internally consistent. (Ref: Intention Revealing Names)</p> </li> <li> <p>When programming,always comment your code, but not too much. The exact line is a matter of (fervent) debate but it is almost universally accepted that having no comments is a bad idea and that its easy to have too many comments. Keep your comments at the start of each source file, and at the start of each method. Occasionally you might want to put a few lines of comments inline. But that desire often alerts you to a refactoring opportunity.</p> </li> <li> <p>When learning new things never fall in love with the shiny toys It's ok to be proud in your expertise and trying to perfect your craft. But platforms and languages come and go, and you must remain alert to newer and better ways to solve problems as they are invented. Don't fall in love with a language or platform. It will change and the specific details you memorized will eventually become useless.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["engineering","rules","software"]},{"location":"2014/04/12/rules-of-thumb-for-software/#credits","title":"Credits","text":"<p>Many of these are from books, blogs and my own experience.

It's always fun to have a top-10 list even in the driest of topics, so here is Barry Boehm's \"Timeless Principles (+) and Aging Practices (-) of Software Engineering!</p> <p>4.1 TimelessPrinciplesandAgingPractices</p> <p>For each decade, I\u2019ve tried to identify two timeless principles headed by plus signs; and one aging practice, headed by a minus sign.</p> <p>From the 1950\u2019s</p> <ul> <li> <p>+  Don\u2019t neglect the sciences. This is the first part of the definition of \u201cengineering\u201d. It should not include just mathematics and computer science, but also behavioral sciences, economics, and management science. It should also include using the scientific method to learn through experience. </p> </li> <li> <p>+  Look before you leap. Premature commitments can be disastrous (Marry in haste; repent at leisure \u2013 when any leisure is available). </p> </li> <li> <p>\u2212 Avoid using a rigorous sequential process. The world is getting too tangeable and unpredictable for this, and it\u2019s usually slower. </p> </li> </ul> <p>From the 1960\u2019s</p> <ul> <li> <p>+  Think outside the box. Repetitive engineering would never have created the Arpanet or Engelbart\u2019s mouse-and-windows GUI. Have some fun prototyping; it\u2019s generally low-risk and frequently high reward. </p> </li> <li> <p>+  Respect software\u2019s differences. You can\u2019t speed up its development indefinitely. Since it\u2019s invisible, you need to find good ways to make it visible and meaningful to different stakeholders. </p> </li> <li> <p>\u2212 Avoid cowboy programming. The last-minute all-nighter frequently doesn\u2019t work, and the patches get ugly fast. </p> </li> </ul> <p>From the 1970\u2019s</p> <ul> <li> <p>+  Eliminate errors early. Even better, prevent them in the future via root cause analysis. </p> </li> <li> <p>+  Determine the system\u2019s purpose. Without a clear shared vision, you\u2019re likely to get chaos and disappointment. Goal-question- metric is another version of this. </p> </li> <li> <p>\u2212 Avoid Top-down development and reductionism. COTS, reuse, IKIWISI, rapid changes and emergent requirements make this increasingly unrealistic for most applications. </p> </li> </ul> <p>From the 1980\u2019s</p> <ul> <li> <p>+  These are many roads to increased productivity, including staffing, training, tools, reuse, process improvement, prototyping, and others. </p> </li> <li> <p>+  What\u2019s good for products is good for process, including architecture, reusability, composability, and adaptability. </p> </li> <li> <p>\u2212 Be skeptical about silver bullets, and one-size-fits-all solutions. </p> </li> </ul> <p>From the 1990\u2019s</p> <ul> <li> <p>+  Time is money. People generally invest in software to get a positive return. The sooner the software is fielded, the sooner the returns come \u2013 if it has satisfactory quality. </p> </li> <li> <p>+  Make software useful to people. This is the other part of the definition of \u201cengineering.\u201d </p> </li> <li> <p>\u2212 Be quick, but don\u2019t hurry. Overambitious early milestones usually result in incomplete and incompatible specifications and lots of rework. </p> </li> </ul> <p>From the 2000s</p> <ul> <li> <p>+  If change is rapid, adaptability trumps repeatability. </p> </li> <li> <p>+  Consider and satisfice all of the stakeholders\u2019 value propositions. If success-critical stakeholders are neglected or exploited, they will generally counterattack or refuse to participate, making everyone a loser. </p> </li> <li> <p>\u2212 Avoid falling in love with your slogans. YAGNI (you aren\u2019t going to need it) is not always true. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For the 2010\u2019s</p> <ul> <li> <p>+  Keep your reach within your grasp. Some systems of systems may just be too big and complex. </p> </li> <li> <p>+  Have an exit strategy. Manage expectations, so that if things go wrong, there\u2019s an acceptable fallback. </p> </li> <li> <p>\u2212 Don\u2019t believe everything you read.

It\u2019s an idea that serves markets, cripples muses, and is willfully ignorant of all of human history.</p> <p>We are stealing from one another constantly and shamelessly, and that\u2019s a blessed and beautiful thing. Every folk song is a mashup of all previous folk songs. Every film stands on the shoulders of all other films. Every sentence, poem and novel exists only for the creative gumption of all previous speakers of language, which is itself a collaborative invention of the entire human race. The whole history of human invention is characterized by a kind of joyful, infinite plagiarism.</p> <p>Ideas are not commodities. They are made to be shared, not owned.</p> <p>That said, I do get the point. If somebody covered one of my songs and got it on the radio and made millions and didn\u2019t pay me, I\u2019d sue the bajeezus out of the motherfucker. If you\u2019re going to turn my song into a commodity, I expect to paid as though it\u2019s a commodity (even though deep in my heart, I know it\u2019s not).</p> <p>BUT, if somebody covered one of my songs and put it on youtube, or wrote a song that was an homage to one of mine, or burned one of my CDs and gave it to a friend, or used a song of mine in their broke-ass indie film, I\u2019d high five them. Why? Because there is a big difference between sharing someone else\u2019s work and profiting off of someone else\u2019s work.</p> <p>And it\u2019s time for all of us to get real, real comfortable with the former.\" </p> <p>-- http://blog.carsieblanton.com</p> <p>What I like about this is that it straddles both my impulse that ideas are not commodities and that everything I create is built upon the shoulders of those who came before.

Prior to that time, he had gained a European reputation as a promising young sculptor. He fielded a series of solo exhibitions in France and Switzerland, and worked on collaborative projects with Pierre Cardin and others. Pascal's career has blossomed in America. He has been awarded several commissions for large-scale installations. Galleries and collectors alike have responded to the simplicity of his approach, which balances geometric abstraction with organic form. There is an undertone of symbolism as well, a hieroglyphic shorthand that hints at other visual languages. Pascal was influenced from a very young age by his grandfather, a wood sculptor. It was from him that Pascal developed his love for wood and his passion for working with it. He creates an extraordinary range of abstract meditations that seem to arise directly from the material itself, rather than from a conscious plan. He has an extraordinary rapport with his materials, concocting his own varnishes and resins as well as creating bronze-like patinas on non-metallic surfaces. He works with a variety of precious woods and creates sculptures that express the texture, aroma, and strength of each. He considers wood to be a feminine material - warm, colorful, full of surprises, and not always easy to control. Therefore, many of his sculptures have a feminine cast, with elegantly swelling contours and subtle curves. Conversely, he sometimes works with more angular, masculine themes, such as his Fleche (Arrow) series, and the wood responds with a robust presence. Pascal's technique is interactive. Each work of art is characterized by a graceful balance, a meticulous attention to detail. Even as he carves and burnishes, he allows the piece to guide him.\u00a0Artist\u2019s Statement\u201cWood has its own intelligence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt knows many things, and it teaches them to me. In this way, I understand what I want to do with it, so that the final image reflects its innate qualities as well as my own thoughts and feelings.\u201d - PascalCurriculum Vitae BORN St. Raphael, France 1962 EDUCATION 1975\u20131980 Art History and Technique, St Raphael, France 1980\u20131982 Aerograph Technique, San Diego, California SELECTED ART-RELATED Ruinart Champagne Project, Miami, Florida Curatorial \u201c1002 Project\u201d Calvin Charles Gallery, Scottsdale, Arizona ART in Schools, 42 child participants, E.J.

Unfortunately, because such practices feel more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion. The reason I say seem and not are is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for. To illustrate what I\u2019m trying to say, I\u2019ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies.

Unfortunately, because such practices feel more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion. The reason I say seem and not are is because the alternatives to these cost- exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for. To illustrate what I'm trying to say, I'll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies.
