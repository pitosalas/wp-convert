is nonetheless very controversial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Apple's success as a technology company is built on hardware. The current
fixation with digital is misplaced." (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5952131/the-

<p>Good article. Read it.</p>

<p>One of the tensions that I have seen in teaching software engineering is
whether something should be viewed as legitimate research or part of the craft
of computer engineering.</p>
<p>It's a slippery slope that I myself didn't have a good articulation for.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/4794/how-would-i-
justify-that-my-work-isnt-just-normal-design-and-creation">this in a newsgroup which I think is a pretty good
description.</a> The writer is
referring to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/141290224X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=141290224X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blogbridge-20">Researching Information Systems and
Computing</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-

<blockquote>
<p>"According to the author, the major differences are that in the typical
software industry is that the less that is learnt or the less that needs to
be discovered the more successful the project is deemed to be. If all is
going according to plan then using existing knowledge, avoiding backtracking
and changing of design or avoiding having to redo analysis would be seen as
a part success. Having to change your design, backtracking and redoing
analysis are perceived as a negative risk which needs to be mitigated. These
risks could overrun the project constraints such as time, budget etc.
Therefore industrial practitioners often leave out risky or uncertain parts
of a project.</p>
<p>A researcher on the other hand focuses on these risky and uncertain items
because tackling these risks and uncertainties successfully would lead to
new knowledge being created. Hence you can claim to be doing research rather
than 'normal' design and creation through the risk taking of your software
product or process. You can further claim justification for your design by
using theoretical underpinnings such as mathematical formulas and or formal
methods from the field. You should also be able to say how the knowledge
aquired from your design can be applied generally to other situations.</p>

<p>I don't know why this <strong>has not gotten more press.</strong> You should take a look at
Microsoft's new Gmail killer, <a href="http://www.outlook.com">outlook.com</a>. It's a
totally web based email client, like Gmail, but the user experience is <strong>miles
and miles better</strong> than Gmail.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen Shot 2012 10 16 at 10 31 48 PM" src="https://i0.wp.com/salas.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/10/dc112-screen20shot202012-10-1620at2010-31-4820pm.png?resize=400%2C240&amp;ssl=1" /></p>
<p>Now I am a <strong>huge Gmail user,</strong> and generally I get along really well with it.
It has years of my emails and I have fully mastered its tricks and hacks. It
<strong>works</strong> , it's reliable and it's free.</p>
<p>But boy, as a user interface, isn't Gmail <strong>UGLY</strong>?</p>
<p>And now look at Microsoft's <a href="http://www.outlook.com">Outlook.com</a>. I didn't
even realize that such <strong>great, responsive</strong> UI could be built in html. It
might still be missing some features, and maybe MSFT will clutter it up when
they add them, but for now, it is <strong>impressive</strong>.</p>
<p>By the way, the world of Outlook.com is new enough that the good email
addresses might still be available, so get your company@outlook.com <strong>while
you still can!</strong></p>

<p>It turns out that Kaspersky Labs is developing a <a href="http://eugene.kaspersky.com/2012/10/16/kl-developing-its-
own-operating-system-we-confirm-the-rumors-and-end-the-speculation/">brand new operating system

<p>In this article, <a href="http://eugene.kaspersky.com/2012/10/16/kl-developing-its-own-
operating-system-we-confirm-the-rumors-and-end-the-speculation/">Eugene Kaspersky explains why his company decided to embark
on the creation of an operating system designed specifically and only for
embedded industrial control
systems.</a></p>
<p>The obvious question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"First I’ll answer the most obvious question: how will it be possible for KL
to create a secure OS if no one at Microsoft, Apple, or the open source
community has been able to fully secure their respective operating systems?
It’s all quite simple really.</p>
<p>"First: our system is highly tailored, developed for solving a specific
narrow task, and not intended for playing Half-Life on, editing your
vacation videos, or blathering on social media. Second: we’re working on
methods of writing software which by design won’t be able to carry out any
behind-the-scenes, undeclared activity. This is the important bit: the
impossibility of executing third-party code, or of breaking into the system
or running unauthorized applications on our OS; and this is both provable
and testable." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://eugene.kaspersky.com/2012/10/16/kl-developing-its-own-

<p>I am looking forward to watching the Presidential debates tonight. But for all
the <strong>wrong</strong> reasons.</p>
<p>I believe I <strong>know pretty clearly</strong> what each side's positions are and what
they points will be. So, like when I watch a car race (which is rarely)
secretly I have to admit that I will enjoy the suspense of seeing <strong>the big
crash</strong> : the screwup, mistake or unscripted moment.</p>
<p>Here's an article that pulls out a bunch of revealing details of the
arrangement between the two sides and the moderator about what can and cannot
be done during the debates. It's pretty revealing and interesting, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The candidates may not ask each other direct questions during any of the four debates."</li>
<li>"The candidates shall not address each other with proposed pledges."</li>
<li>"At no time during the October 3 First Presidential debate shall either candidate move from his designated area behing the respective podium."</li>
<li>For the October 16 town-hall-style debate, "the moderator will not ask follow-up questions or comment on either the questions asked by the audience or the answers of the candidates during the debate…."</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the <a href="http://gawker.com/5951977/leaked-debate-agreement-
shows-both-obama-and-romney-are-sniveling-cowards">whole article</a> which also includes a
<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/110073567">link to the pdf of the 'contract' that both sides
signed.</a> Again, pretty revealing.</p>
<p>By the way, do we blame the media for promoting the "<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCAQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLDf0NF32Vs8&amp;ei=xZp9UIWzIcTdqAGGqoDYAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_3ehPLlg1mad2Fbq5WVOkpqt7tg&amp;sig2=0xYeFwTcNWb1q6OESQj1CQ">cage
fight</a>"
view of the debates? No, we should blame ourselves. They are just showing us
what they know we will tune in for.</p>
<p>(Also, this just in, commentary in Esquire "<a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/second-presidential-

<p>From the New York Times, an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/kristof-a-possibly-
fatal-mistake.html">article by Nick Kristof, describing a real-life
story of a friend of his and health
care.</a></p>
<p>Whenever I hear, "We have the best health care in the world", I think of
stories like this. It is a travesty that in a wealthy country like the USA,
there are 48 million Americans uninsured. Some 27,000 Americans between the
ages of 25 and 65 die prematurely every year because they don't have health
insurance. From the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/kristof-a-
possibly-fatal-mistake.html">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Let’s just stipulate up front that Scott blew it. Other people are
sometimes too poor to buy health insurance or unschooled about the risks.
Scott had no excuse. He could have afforded insurance, and while working in
the pension industry he became expert on actuarial statistics; he knew
precisely what risks he was taking. He’s the first to admit that he screwed
up catastrophically and may die as a result.</p>
<p>Yet remember also that while Scott was foolish, mostly he was unlucky. He is
a bachelor, so he didn’t have a spouse whose insurance he could fall back on
in his midlife crisis. In any case, we all take risks, and usually we get
away with them. Scott is a usually prudent guy who took a chance, and then
everything went wrong." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/opinion/sunday/kristof-a-possibly-
fatal-mistake.html">The New York
Times</a>)</p>

<p>Does Google give a different answer if you reorder the words in the search?
What? A trivial question? Have you ever tried to refine a search by reordering
the words? Wouldn't it be useful if you knew for sure that it would or would
not make a difference?</p>
<p>Experiment:</p>
<pre><code>ruby rails bureaucrat gem examples


rails bureaucrat gem examples ruby
</code></pre>
<p>These two searches indeed did produce different results! And not just a
reordering of the results. There were at least two results in the top 7 which
were present in one and not the other.</p>

      <h2 id="vote-buying-measures-and-countermeasures"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/10/12/vote-buying-measures-and-countermeasures/">Vote Buying measures and countermeasures</a></h2>
<p>An interesting question, and an expert answer from a friend of mine. If you
are interested in elections and voting and how they can and cannot be bought,
you might find this intriguing. By the way, this scheme would never work in
the US as we have many mechanisms that would prevent that, but these might
apply in other countries that are not as sophisticated.</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say a bad guy made an offer secretly to the population that he would give
each voter $100 for a vote cast for himself. Say they are using optical scan
ballots. Say that cell phone cameras are easily snuck into the polling
booth.</p>
<p>If you were the bad guy, what proof would you ask for so that people
couldn't trick you and collect lots of $100 for votes that they really
didn't cast. And if you were the government or an activist, what would you
tell people about how to trick the bad guy and collect a bunch of $100
bills?:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the Australian ballot, it was easy! Anybody can print a ballot, lots
of straight party ballots printed. You go to your party boss in your polling
place, he gives you a ballot, you put in the box, simple. When the party
bosses were excluded, well, you had to get your ballot from him, and minions
could observe you not getting a different. With some slight of hand you
could trick them, but still very effective b/c most people won't attempt the
slight of hand under threat of kneecapping. The almost as soon as Australian
ballot was adopted (you might get a blank ballot from a government official
in the polling place and mark it in the polling place), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_scan_voting_system">chain
voting</a> was
invented.</p>
<p>Now, today, chain voting is too pesky and low throughput, how about we use
the voter's digital camera in the polling booth! The can take a picture of
the ballot that they marked as instructed by the boss. You show the boss a
picture on your camera, he gives you money and/or spares your kneecaps. But
wait! The digital photo can be faked? Hmmm.</p>
<p>I think that is the stage you've set. There are two main questions. What
methods can the boss put in place to increase the difficulty of faked
photos? What measures can election officials take to make it more difficult
for real photos to be produced?</p>
<p>A separate question, new to me: if you were the government or an activist,
what would you tell people about how to trick the bad guy and collect a
bunch of $100 bills? You bear in mind that it is not just money. The deal
might be this: you show me you voted right and I'll give you money; you
don't show me, and my goons bust your kneecaps.</p>
<p>Well, if I were the gov't, I would be forbidding the use of cameras or
cellphones or any kind of recording device in polling places, rather than
telling people it is OK. Allowing recording devices in the voting booth is
creating the opportunity for vote intimidation. You never want that.</p>
<p>So let me go back to the two main questions. I would suggest to election
officials that ballot marking be done in three sided carrels made of
translucent plastic that will mask a view of the ballot being marked, but
allow a view of the use of recording devices.</p>
<p>There would need to be lots of training both of voters -- we really don't
want you to using recording devices! -- and poll workers to intervene by
asking a voter to please mark a ballot again, because this one you marked
and then did some weird stuff in the carrel that looked like taking a photo.</p>
<p>The boss has a harder time. Clearly a photo of a properly marked ballot
won't do, b/c anybody can make one of those. The photo would need to include
something that showed the ballot and me, together. So probably it should
include my hand as something that should be unique and distinguishing. Maybe
the boss could stamp my wrist with a unique number, in ink that takes days
to wear off. Even so, I could prepare a photo combining a properly marked
ballot, and my hand, but not the ballot that I cast! If pre-printed ballots
are freely available, then I can prepare a photo that the boss expects, but
still vote a real secret ballot in the polling place. I could even make a
fake picture in the voting booth, using a pre-made ballot, but then marking
a real blank ballot and casting that. From there you are in a spy vs spy
sort of games with more boss requirements on the photo, making it more
difficult to fake, but also more difficult get away with in the real voting
booth.</p>

<p>I recently subscribed to the New York Review of Books. Not sure this was a
good decision as the last thing I need is more stuff to read. I came to it
because I kept seeing interesting articles from the NYRB come up on various
blogs and searches.</p>
<p>Here's quite an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098?ie=UTF8&amp;assoc_ss_swlb=1&amp;creativeASIN=0199812098&amp;redirect=true">interesting book
review</a>
of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199812098&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blogbridge-20">Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and
Naturalism</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0199812098" /> ". This sets the tone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the things atheists tend to believe is that modern science is on
their side, whereas theism is in conflict with science: that, for example,
belief in miracles is inconsistent with the scientific conception of natural
law; faith as a basis of belief is inconsistent with the scientific
conception of knowledge; belief that God created man in his own image is
inconsistent with scientific explanations provided by the theory of
evolution. In his absorbing new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199812098&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blogbridge-20">Where the Conflict Really Lies:
Science, Religion, and
Naturalism</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0199812098" /> a distinguished
analytic philosopher known for his contributions to metaphysics and theory
of knowledge as well as to the philosophy of religion, turns this alleged
opposition on its head. His overall claim is that “there is superficial
conflict but deep concord between science and theistic religion, but
superficial concord and deep conflict between science and naturalism.” By
naturalism he means the view that the world describable by the natural
sciences is all that exists, and that there is no such person as God, or
anything like God." (from <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/philosopher-
defends-religion/?pagination=false">New York Review of
Books)</a></p>
