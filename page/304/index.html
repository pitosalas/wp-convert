<p>I came across a very <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strategic-Plan-Neither/128227/">provocative article about why and how universities seem
to often get buried in a time consuming and torturous process of strategic
planning</a>.</p>
<p>My experience in the private sector is that it is <strong>very easy</strong> to get sucked
into a process that takes on a life of its own and sucks a massive amount of
time out of the organization for very questionable outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong> : I don't claim that I have a broad view on this, as my experience
is quite limited but I'll just say that for my money "Strategic Plans" are the
management equivalent of "Big Design Up Front", both of which I try to
<strong>limit</strong> as much as possible.</p>
<p>Remember I am <strong>neither against planning nor design.</strong> I am <strong>against</strong>
spending <strong>massive</strong> resources on the creation of massive documents which are
<strong>out of date</strong> as soon they are written down, and are <strong>never</strong> ever looked
at again.</p>
<p>Here's the conclusion from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This interchangeability of visions for the future underscores the fact that
the precise content of most colleges' strategic plans is pretty much
irrelevant. Plans are usually forgotten soon after they are promulgated.</p>
<p>My university has presented two systemwide strategic plans and one arts-and-
sciences strategic plan in the past 15 years. No one can remember much about
any of those plans, but another one is in the works.</p>
<p>The plan is not a blueprint for the future. It is, instead, a management
tool for the present. The ubiquity of planning at America's colleges and
universities is another reflection and reinforcement of the continuing
growth of administrative power." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strategic-Plan-
Neither/128227/">The Strategic Plan: Neither
Strategy Nor Plan…"</a></p>

<p>A SPANISH Teacher was explaining to her class that in Spanish, unlike English,
nouns are designated as either masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>'House' for instance, is feminine: 'la casa.'<br />
'Pencil,' however, is masculine: 'el lapiz.'</p>
<p>A student asked, 'What gender is 'computer'?'</p>
<p>Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the class into two groups,
male and female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether computer'
should be a masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four
reasons for its recommendation.</p>
<p>The men's group decided that 'computer' should definitely be of the feminine
gender ('la computadora'), because:</p>
<p>1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;</p>
<p>2 The native language they use to communicate with other computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else;</p>
<p>3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible
later retrieval; and</p>
<p>4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.</p>
<p>The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be Masculine ('el
computador'), because:</p>
<p>1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on;</p>
<p>2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;</p>
<p>3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE
the problem; and</p>
<p>4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little
longer, you could have gotten a better model.</p>
<p>The women won.</p>

      <h2 id="education-creative-monopoly"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/04/26/education-creative-monopoly/">[education] Creative Monopoly</a></h2>
<p>An interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-creative-
monopoly.html?_r=1">article by David Brooks in the New York Times commenting on
the views of the always controversial Peter
Thiel.</a></p>
<p>[Why is he controversial? Because he h<a href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/become-a-
fellow/about-the-program/">as a grant program for students who are
so passionate about their startup idea that they are willing to drop out of
college to get the grant</a>. Which is ironic because in the article, Brooks is
citing what Thiel is teaching in his Stanford COURSE!]</p>
<p>The article is about Thiel's views on what and how students get taught in
college:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"First, students have to jump through ever-more demanding, preassigned
academic hoops. Instead of developing a passion for one subject, they're
rewarded for becoming professional students, getting great grades across all
subjects, regardless of their intrinsic interests.</p>
<p>Instead of wandering across strange domains, they have to prudentially
apportion their time, making productive use of each hour." (from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-
creative-monopoly.html?_r=1">The
Creative Monopoly)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would that be bad? Read on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"… We live in a culture that nurtures competitive skills. And they are
necessary: discipline, rigor and reliability. But it’s probably a good idea
to try to supplement them with the skills of the creative monopolist:
alertness, independence and the ability to reclaim forgotten traditions."
(from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-creative-
monopoly.html?_r=1">The Creative
Monopoly)</a></p>

<p>This book looks good: "Founder's Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the
pitfalls that can sink a startup". I came across it in the "Startup Lessons
Learned" Blog, which may be the best blog about leann startups.</p>
<p>This excerpt talks about a common scenario with startups, where the founders
assume that they way they chose to split equity on day 0 will continue to work
for them as time goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How should founders deal with such developments? In short, by assuming when
they do the initial split that things will change, even if the specific
changes cannot be foreseen, and therefore structuring a dynamic equity split
rather than the static splits used at Zipcar, govWorks, and many other
startups. As important as it is to get the initial equity split rightâby
matching it as closely as possible thefoundersâ past contributions,
opportunity costs, future contributions, and motivationsâit is equally
important to keep it right; that is, to be able to adjust the split as
circumstances change." (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Founder's Dilemmas: Equity
Splits)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I will be getting the book.</p>
<p><em>p.s. not to be a scrooge, but shouldn 't the title be "Founders' Dilemmas"?</em></p>

<p>If you are a theatre fan I strongly recommend a play I just saw last night.
It's called "Luck of the Irish". From a <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-13/arts/31325980_1_white-
couple-black-homebuyers-lucy">review on
Boston.com:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"… It's one of numerous instances in Greenidge's superb, beautifully
realized new play -- now receiving its premiere in a Huntington Theatre
Company production directed by Melia Bensussen -- that illustrate the
playwright's sure grasp of the nuances of race and class and her insights
into the complexities of human nature." (<strong>from</strong>

<p>Run, don't walk to see this <a href="http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/2011-2012/The-Luck-of-the-

<p>Listen, I <strong>love</strong> the New York Times. I read it cover to cover (or pixel to
pixel) every day and have it delivered in dead-tree format to my doorstep each
morning.</p>
<p>But so often I come across an awkward sentence which I have to read and re-
read several times to understand.</p>
<p>I've been noticing this for a long time now and it makes me wonder whether
it's a stylistic thing or a that they have had to <strong>lay off</strong> their best
editors.</p>
<p>At any rate, I don't have the same impression when I read he Wall Street
Journal (which I <strong>admire</strong> but <strong>don 't</strong> love.)</p>
<p>Here's a recent example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LAGOS, Nigeria -- In a quarter-century, at the rate Nigeria is growing, 300
million people -- a population about as big as that of the present-day
United States -- will live in a country roughly the size of Arizona, New
Mexico and Nevada." (from
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/world/africa/in-nigeria-a-preview-

sam-spade-at-starbucks.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">David Brooks of the New York Times, in an article about (my interpretation)
the limits of idealism:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s hard not to feel inspired by all these idealists, but their service
religion does have some shortcomings. In the first place, many of these
social entrepreneurs think they can evade politics. They have little faith
in the political process and believe that real change happens on the ground
beneath it.</p>
<p>That’s a delusion. You can cram all the nongovernmental organizations you
want into a country, but if there is no rule of law and if the ruling class
is predatory then your achievements won’t add up to much." (from "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/opinion/brooks-sam-spade-
at-starbucks.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">Sam Spade
at Starbucks"</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My favorite line from "The Maltese Falcon" (from memory, so paraphrased):
"Loose a son, you can always get yourself a new one, but… there's <strong>only one
Maltese Falcon.</strong> "</p>
<p>Anyway, that's off topic.</p>
<p>This article makes the case that if you are not happy with the ways
"<strong>things</strong> " (the world, your town, your company) are run, you can't make
fundamental change other than engaging with "<strong>the system "</strong>.</p>

<p>Ok, I don't agree with all of "<a href="http://halfhalf.posterous.com/dont-work-be-hated-love-
someone">Don’t work. Avoid telling the truth. Be hated.
Love someone"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Resist the temptation to get a job. Instead, play. Find something you enjoy
doing. Do it. Over and over again. You will become good at it for two
reasons: you like it, and you do it often. Soon, that will have value in
itself."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but there are some good lessons and reminders in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Find that pursuit that will energise you, consume you, become an obsession.
Each day, you must rise with a restless enthusiasm. If you don’t, you are
working."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's <a href="http://halfhalf.posterous.com/dont-work-be-

<p>I <strong>love</strong> this article. It's by an <a href="http://tim-
parks.com/">actual author </a>talking about whether it matters if a reader reads a book through
to the very end.</p>
<p>He starts with the basics, claiming that serious ('<strong>mature</strong> ') readers don't
feel self-imposed pressure to read a book to its very last syllable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It seems obvious that any serious reader will have learned long ago how
much time to give a book before choosing to shut it. It’s only the young,
still attached to that sense of achievement inculcated by anxious parents,
who hang on doggedly when there is no enjoyment. “ (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/mar/13/why-finish-
books/">Why Finish
Books)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Agreed</strong>.</p>
<p>He then gets into much subtler ground: what the experience is of the author or
writer in <strong>deciding</strong> whether it's time to <strong>wrap things</strong> <strong>up</strong> and bring
the story (and the book, not always the same thing) to it's conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kafka remarked that beyond a certain point a writer might decide to finish
his or her novel at any moment, with any sentence; it really was an
arbitrary question, like where to cut a piece of string, and in fact both
The Castle and America are left unfinished, while The Trial is tidied away
with the indecent haste of someone who has decided enough is enough.“
(<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/mar/13/why-finish-
books/">Why Finish
Books)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article has several other <strong>neat scenarios</strong> and examples and ends with
this, from the point of view of the author himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And finally I wonder if it isnât perhaps time that I learned, in my own
novels, to drop readers a hint or two that, from this or that moment on,
they have my permission to let the book go just as and when they choose."
(<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/mar/13/why-finish-
books/">Why Finish
Books)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A provocatively titled article (<a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/03/26/why-youth-has-an-advantage-
in-innovation-why-you-want-to-be-a-learn-it-all/">Why Youth Has an Advantage In
Innovation)</a> argues that to innovate you
have to be an <strong>omnivorous</strong> and <strong>promiscuous</strong> consumer of new stuff. Try
this list on for size, does it fit?</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>When a new device or operating system comes out do you rush out to get
it as soon as possible – just because you want to play with the new
features? Or do you wait for the dust to settle so that you don’t make a
mistaken purchase. Or because you don’t want to waste your time.</li>
<li>Do you use LinkedIn for all of your recruiting, or do you mistakenly
think that LinkedIn is only for job seekers? How many connections do you
have? Is your profile up to date? (When Yahoo announced Carol Bartz as CEO,
I did a quick search on LinkedIn. She was not a registered user.)</li>
<li>When you heard that Zynga’s Farmville had over 80MM monthly users, did
you immediately launch the game to see what it was all about, or do you make
comments about how mindless it is to play such a game? Have you ever
launched a single Facebook game?</li>
<li>Do you have an Android phone or do you still use a Blackberry because
your Chief Security Officer says you have to? I know many “innovators” who
carry an iPhone and an Android, simply because they know these are the
smartphones that customers use. And they want exposure to both platforms –
at a tactile level.</li>
<li>Do you use the internal camera app on your iPhone because it’s easy, or
have you downloaded Instgram to find out why 27mm other people use that
instead?</li>
<li>Do you leverage Twitter to improve your influence and position in your
industry or is it more comfortable for you to declare, “why would I tweet?,”
before you even fully understand the product or why people in similar roles
are leveraging the medium? Do you follow the industry leaders in your field
on Twitter? Do you follow your competitors and customers? Do you track your
company’s products and reputation?</li>
<li>How many apps are on your smart phone? Do you have well over 50, or
even 100, because you are routinely downloading each and every app from each
peer and competitor you can to see how others are exploiting the
environment? Do you know how WhatsApp, Voxer, and Path leveraged the iphone
contact list for viral distribution?</li>
<li>Do you know what Github is and why most startups rely on it as the key
center of their engineering effort?</li>
<li>Have you ever mounted an AWS server at Amazon? Do you know how AWS
pricing works?</li>
<li>Does it make sense to you to use HTML5 as your mobile solution so that
you don’t have to code for multiple platforms? Does it bother you that none
of the leading smartphone app vendors take this approach?</li>
<li>When you are on the road on business, do you let your assistant book
the same old car service, or do you tell them, “I want to use Uber just to
see how it works?”</li>
<li>When Facebook launched the new timeline feature did you immediately
build one to see what the company was up to, or did you dismiss this as
something you shouldn’t waste your time on?</li>
<li>Have you been to <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor.com</a> to see
what employees are saying about your company? Or have you rationalized why
it’s not important, the way the way the old-school small business owner
formerly dismissed his/her Yelp review.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Other than the obnoxious title the article does make some good points. I do
believe this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"f you want to stay “young” and innovative, you have no choice but to
immerse yourself in the emerging tools of the current and next generation.
You MUST stay current, as it is illusionary to imagine being innovative
without being current." (<strong>From</strong> <a href="http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/03/26/why-youth-has-an-advantage-in-
innovation-why-you-want-to-be-a-learn-it-all/">Why You Want to Be A Learn-it-
All</a></p>
