<p>A really excellent <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8388695/Godless-in-
Tumourville-Christopher-Hitchens-interview.html">interview/review of Christopher Hitchens and his memoir,
"Hitch-22":</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He could never have guessed how prescient those words would be. In June
last year, while on a tour of America to promote the hardback publication of
his book, Hitchens was taken ill in New York and was subsequently diagnosed
with cancer of the oesophagus. Thus did he acquire his visa to a place where
nothing can be taken for granted. Hitchens has christened it 'Tumourville’."

<p><strong>" Oh yeah, I've started 6 companies, and right now I have 3 startups going.
I just love starting companies. I don't know what's wrong with me…."</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever heard statements like that?</p>
<p>I hear them, fairly often, and I am never sure what to make of them. My
immediate impulse is to call "Bullshit", but I don't because part of me
admires that attitude. It's just like the moniker "Serial Entrepreneur" seems
to have become a status symbol. It doesn't matter if the result of your
seriality is that you are broke or forced the indignity of becoming a
'salaryman' at a regular company, oh, like Google. Being a serial Entrepreneur
is cool.</p>
<p>I hope you realize that I am being ironic. I happen to think that Google is an
amazing company and people who have a job there have it good and have reason
to be proud.</p>
<p>So, I enjoyed reading <a href="http://spencerfry.com/startup-
vs-company">"Startup vs. Company"</a> a blog post by Spencer Fry, with the subtitle "Startups easy.
Companies hard.", in which he says, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They tried to claim that they were currently working on a half dozen
startups (what I'd term "projects"; a startup needs focused development),
and as the dispute developed they also insisted that Facebook and Twitter
were still startups and not companies. "You can't use the term for
everything," I said, "just because it's an online product." Maybe it's a New
York vs. San Francisco thing, but in New York we're building companies, not
startups. Maybe it's because it costs more to live here, but we're trying to
put food on the table, not be on the <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/dont_believe_businessweeks_bubblemath.php" title="Business Week">cover of Business
Week</a>." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://spencerfry.com/startup-vs-company">Startup vs.
Company</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(It will make <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/">Scott
Kirsner's</a> heart beat
faster when he realizes that the conversation being quoted above was between
Spencer Fry, from <strong>New York</strong> , and '<strong>two guys from San Fransisco</strong> " about
the meaning of the word 'Startup')</p>
<p>I take Spencer Fry's side in this debate. The term 'startup' and 'company', at
least in the mouths of our community, have experienced serious devaluation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What makes creating a company so difficult is that it's no longer a couple
of people sitting around their apartment fine-tuning an idea. Those were the
days! It's a team, all working together to solve a complex problem. Then if
you're lucky enough to solve it, you have to sell, market, and support it.
It starts to get scary.</p>
<p>Building a business is mind numbing when you think about it. You have to be
a little insane to venture down this path. Your chances of succeeding are
slim, and even if you do succeed you have to continue to innovate or you'll
be obsolete in eighteen months." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://spencerfry.com/startup-vs-company">Startup vs.
Company</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just something to keep in mind the next time you say or hear a statement like
I began with.</p>

<p>It's <strong>hard to believe</strong> , but here is what I got from Mint.com when I asked
why my Bank of America info was not updating on Mint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Pito,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Mint.com.</p>
<p>According to our engineers, we <strong>can 't support Bank of America</strong> due to
unsupported authentication and/or challenge question format. We are,
unfortunately, able to support the addition of products from that account at
this time.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and we appreciate your patience in this
regard.</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
Naddy L.<br />
Mint.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <strong>Mint.com no longer supprts Bank of America accounts</strong>. Isn't Bank of
America one of the biggest (or THE biggest US bank?)</p>
<p>I am most certainly not having a nice day. Time to move on from Mint.com.</p>

<p>I know it's a <strong>provocative title</strong> , and sadly I suspect that many of the
'intended audience' will agree with much of what he says, but then also feel
like there's nothing that can be done about it.</p>
<p>I am a <strong>waning fan</strong> of the Sunday TV news shows. Nowadays it is so easy if
you are inclined to keep up with the news, moment by moment that it's hard to
find much more than the usual platitudes and repetition.</p>
<p>Fareed Zakaria's GPS program on Sundays for me is now easily the best. He has
interesting, thoughtful segments that don't fall into that boring greyness
that the rest of TV news has become. Nowadays, I only tune in to TV news for
the visuals.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html">Fareed Zakaria's new editorial in TIME
magazine</a>
tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The following rankings come from various lists, but they all tell the same
story.</p>
<p>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), our 15-year-olds rank 17th in the world in science and 25th in math.
We rank 12th among developed countries in college graduation (down from No.
1 for decades). We come in 79th in elementary-school enrollment. Our
infrastructure is ranked 23rd in the world, well behind that of every other
major advanced economy. American health numbers are stunning for a rich
country: based on studies by the OECD and the World Health Organization,
we're 27th in life expectancy, 18th in diabetes and first in obesity. Only a
few decades ago, the U.S. stood tall in such rankings. No more. There are
some areas in which we are still clearly No. 1, but they're not ones we
usually brag about. We have the most guns. We have the most crime among rich
countries. And, of course, we have by far the largest amount of debt in the
world." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html">Fareed
Zakaria</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Old news, right?</strong> I have seen stats like this before, and they are
depressing. And yet any attempt to even talk about this is immediately shot
down.</p>
<p>Also depressing is that for all that they are 'common knowledge' it seems like
<strong>our leaders are unable to get out of the mode that they are in:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So why are we tackling our economic problems in a manner that is
shortsighted and wrong-footed? Because it is <strong>politically easy</strong>. The key
to understanding the moves by both parties is that, for the most part, they
are targeting programs that have neither a wide base of support nor
influential interest groups behind them. (And that's precisely why they're
not where the money is. The American political system is actually quite
efficient. It distributes the big bucks to popular programs and powerful
special interests.)</p>
<p>And neither side will even talk about tax increases, though it is impossible
to achieve long-term fiscal stability without them. Certain taxes — such as
ones on carbon or gas — would have huge benefits beyond revenue, like energy
efficiency." (from <a href="http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html">Fareed
Zakaria</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any politician who dares suggest that the U.S. can learn from — let alone
copy — other countries is likely to be denounced instantly.</p>
<p>If someone points out that Europe gets better health care at half the cost,
that's dangerously socialist thinking.</p>
<p>If a business leader notes that tax rates in much of the industrialized
world are lower and that there are far fewer loopholes than in the U.S., he
is brushed aside as trying to impoverish American workers. If a commentator
says — correctly — that social mobility from one generation to the next is
greater in many European nations than in the U.S., he is laughed at.</p>
<p>Yet several studies, the most recent from the OECD last year, have found
that the average American has a much lower chance of moving out of his
parents' income bracket than do people in places like Denmark, Sweden,
Germany and Canada. (from <a href="http://www.fareedzakaria.com/home/Articles/Entries/2011/3/3_Are_Americas_Best_Days_Behind_Us.html">Fareed
Zakaria</a>)</p>

<p>I probably will be branded as a socialist just for liking this article.</p>

      <h2 id="charitable-mutual-funds-updated"><a class="toclink" href="../../2011/03/11/charitable-mutual-funds-updated/">Charitable Mutual Funds (updated)</a></h2>
<p>[<strong>Note</strong> : don't assume you know what a Charitable Mutual Fund is. It's an
evocative but really misleading name but I don't have a better handle for it
yet. This is not an investment vehicle, it does not return any money. It is
way to allow a donor to donate to one or more causes that match certain
objectives. Please read on…]</p>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong> : What if I wanted to make a charitable gift to reputable non
profits, who work in my state, who focus on homelessness? I could research it
with various services (such as <a href="http://www2.guidestar.org/">GuideStar</a>) I
might see one or two that speak to me, and decide to write a check or two. Now
of course they would come back to me a year later (or sooner) to ask for
another donation, and maybe I would or maybe I'd like to pick a different one.</p>
<p>So here's an idea that (literally) came to me in a dream. I don't remember the
story line but this idea stuck with me.</p>
<p>What if there was an organization (itself a non-profit) that automated this
and did this for me. In other words, I would fill out a form describing the
kind of work I wanted to support:</p>
<p><img alt="Screen shot 2011 03 11 at 11 05 21 AM" src="https://i0.wp.com/salas.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/03/33084-screen-
shot-2011-03-11-at-110521-am.png?resize=462%2C278&amp;ssl=1" /></p>
<p>With that information I sent in a check for say $1,000.00. They would
<strong>immediately apportion</strong> that check according to my specification and make
one or more donations on my behalf. If I wanted to do this say annually, they
would could manage that as well.</p>
<p>I call this a "<strong>Charitable Mutual Fund</strong> " because, like a mutual fund, a
entrust a third party to 'invest' my funds according to a certain guideline
that I give it. And I empower them to adjust the donations based on their
judgement of the individual causes.</p>
<p><strong>Now the term "Mutual Fund" could be very misleading and therefore might be
totally wrong. </strong>It implies investment and appreciation. What I am describing
here is not an investment vehicle at all and would actually not hold on to any
funds at all, nor would it have any returns for donors.</p>
<p>Charitable Mutual Funds could either be "<strong>actively managed</strong> ", where a
presumably smart board of advisors would determine the best and most deserving
charities that matched my particular focus, or they could operate like an
"<strong>index fund</strong> " where an algorithm would simply grab the 10 or 50 highest
rated charities and distribute donated funds pro-rata.</p>
<p><strong>Does this already exist?</strong> I did a quick web search and saw no evidence of
it but it strikes me as something that easily could have been created before.
At any rate, I am in no position to implement this myself. I also think it
would be non-trivial to build with challenging legal, tax, confidence and
marketing issues to figure out. But if it doesn't exist, it might be a great
boost to the world of non profits.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p><em>… ….. later in the day……….</em></p>
<p><strong>One problem</strong> with the idea as described is that makes the act of donating
to a cause very impersonal. You always read, make sure you've looked into
whatever cause you want to support to make sure it is what you are looking
for. Follow what they are doing. Get to know them. The model I describe flies
in the face of that.</p>
<p>Now of course the same could be (and was) said about stock mutual funds. Only
invest in companies you really know, don't just copy someone else's investment
ideas. But of course we learned that there is a very real role for stock
mutual funds.</p>
<p>A second response would be that our service would have an option where you
received a quarterly update indicating what charities were supported by your
donations, what they have done, and so on. Or you could even have a chance to
approve a change in the roster of charities that your donation would be going
to.</p>
<p>So there are good ways to overcome this objection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.qwiki.com">Qwiki seems to create multi-media presentations on any topic at
all.</a> I picked an odd topic, like "<a href="http://www.qwiki.com/q/#!/BlogBridge">BlogBridge", and
it did a half decent job</a>. I don't
know how automatic or human-driven it is, but it's interesting.</p>
<p>Another interesting find is <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com">Fotopedia</a>, "The
First Collaborative Photo Encyclopedia". It's interesting but it suffers from
an unclear mission. I think it's trying to be wikipedia meets flickr, but I am
not sure. <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/items/flickr-3255348609">As you can see from this link, there's some actual connection to

<p>If I could fool you into believing that a fake rubber hand that you were
looking at was really your own hand, how would you react if I took a knife to
it? Weird questions that Neuro-science researchers busy themselves with, but
really fairly amazing. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=need-an-extra-
hand-researchers-conv-2011-02-23">Here's an article in Scientific American about the
study:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A knife-wielding researcher is bearing down on your right hand—or is it
your hand? You see three arms in front of you, and you can feel your palms
dampen with fear-induced perspiration. But is it your right hand the kitchen
knife is plunging toward, or a false, rubber right hand?" (<strong>from</strong>
