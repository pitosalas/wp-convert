<p>I would love to see this trend accelerate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The five-year-old [Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship] program,
[Wake Forest University's] most popular minor, requires students to learn
the practical aspects of starting a business. It is a sign of change in
liberal-arts colleges, which are grappling with the responsibility of
preparing students for a tight and rapidly shifting job market while still
providing the staples of academic inquiry." (from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303448404577410592488795980.html?mod=rss_most_emailed_week&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wsj%2Fxml%2Frss%2F3_7253+%28WSJ.com%3A+Most+Emailed+Week%29&amp;utm_content=My+Yahoo">Wall Street
Journal</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really important in my opinion, and it's a big part of what we cover
in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jbs2012cosiwebsocial/">course I am co-teaching at Brandeis this year, "Web and Social
Apps".</a> The course
starts next week and runs for 10 weeks, practically full time. During that
course students go through the whole cycle of conceiving a product, designing,
implementing and deploying it to the world. It's an exciting experience.
Fairly exhausting for everyone involved, but worth it.</p>
<p>I wish all college students, especially in my field, Computer Science, were
thought learn theory and critical thinking, <strong>but also got exposed</strong> (and were
even required) to learn what I like to call "<strong>critical doing "</strong>. Working in
teams, inventing and creating things that others could benefit of, could touch
and feel, and could have an impact in the real world.</p>
<p>The truth is that in many Universities, this is not a priority today, but
there is signs that the students and parents (the customers after all) are
demanding this. Change is slow, but it is coming.</p>

<p>The other day I referenced an <a href="/imported-20111103233638/2012/5/4/education-strategic-plans-are-they-
worth-the-paper-they-are.html">article questioning the motivation and
effectiveness of large scale strategic planning exercises in universities
today.</a></p>
<p>In this vein I was interested to see this <a href="https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Strategy/Strategy_in_Practice/The_social_side_of_strategy_2965">article describing how certain
organizations have totally thrown open the process of developing and
communicating
strategy</a>
by employing some good old crowd sourcing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In 2009, Wikimedia1 launched a special wiki—one dedicated to the
organization’s own strategy. Over the next two years, more than 1,000
volunteers generated some 900 proposals for the company’s future direction
and then categorized, rationalized, and formed task forces to elaborate on
them.</p>
<p>The result was a coherent strategic plan detailing a set of beliefs,
priorities, and related commitments that together engendered among
participants a deep sense of dedication to Wikimedia’s future.</p>
<p>Through the launch of several special projects and the continued work of
self-organizing teams dedicated to specific proposals, the vision laid out
in the strategic plan is now unfolding." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Strategy/Strategy_in_Practice/The_social_side_of_strategy_2965">The Social Side of

<p>I have often been heard to say: "Ideas are Cheap", by which I mean to say that
my admiration goes more with the implementation, the making real and tangible,
of an idea than the idea itself. It's much easier to come up with something
that would be cool and useful ("A solar powered ambulance", "a retractable and
reusable parachute", "email on steroids") than actually design it, build it,
realize it.</p>
<p>I believe that as much about my own ideas as about anyone else's. BlogBridge
was supposed to be "an RSS reader done right".</p>
<p>I have a few wonderful ideas for new products, like "Twittepedia" which is an
encyclopedia with 140 character definitions. Wouldn't it be nice not to be
able to learn what "geometry", or "racisim" or "bernoulli effect" are without
having to read a 10,000 words wikipedia article?</p>
<p>There, I just gave it away. Why? Because ideas are cheap, and building that
service and making it successful is what really counts.</p>
<p>As it turns out, <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/05/10/mark-twain-helen-
keller-plagiarism-originality/">Mark Twain had the same
idea.</a> So you see, even the idea that Ideas Are
Cheap is itself cheap. How meta.</p>
<p>This is from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1144580935/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=blogbridge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1144580935">Mark Twain's Letters, Volume

<p>"…or substantially <strong>all ideas are second-hand</strong> , consciously and
unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources, and daily use by the
garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the <strong>superstition that he
originated them;</strong> whereas there is not a rag of originality about them
anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral
calibre and his temperament, and which is revealed in characteristics of
phrasing…</p>
<p>… in some degree, and we call it his; but there are others that contributed.
It takes a <strong>thousand men</strong> to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a
phonograph, or a telephone or any other important thing — and the last man
gets the credit and we forget the others. He added his little mite — that is
all he did. These object lessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts of
all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple;
and the lesson ought to make us modest. But nothing can do that…."</p>

      <h2 id="social-networks-good-or-bad"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/05/15/social-networks-good-or-bad/">Social Networks: Good or Bad?</a></h2>
<p>I've been doing quite a bit of reading about social networks in preparation
for the 2012 edition of my Brandeis University Course, "<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jbs2012cosiwebsocial/">Web and Social
Applications</a>". This
morning I was preparing lecture notes for "Current Issues In Social Networks".
Here are some good current links I have been able to find:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/8930/">Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-medias-small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/">Social Media's Small Positive Role in Human Relationships</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-05-14/social-media-and-loneliness">Diane Rehm's Program about Social Media and Loneliness</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?pagewanted=all">The Flight from Conversation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have just come from a family reunion where there were people pulling out
iPhones at 'inappropriate times' and other people debating what has happened
to the art of conversation now that we are all Facebooking all the time.
(Guilty as charged!)</p>
<p>So between the two I have spent some time thinking about this phenomenon and
whether social networks and mobile phones together are a <strong>new kind of
addictive behavior</strong> which is doing real damage to social interactions (that
is, human to human, face to face.)</p>
<p>Or on the other hand, are they just an <strong>evolution of interaction</strong> and
communication and anyone who doesn't see it as an equally valid way of
interacting must be a fuddy duddy. Good question! And I don't really know the
answer, not even what I myself think about it.</p>
<p>But this article by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-medias-
small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/">Zaynep
Tufekci</a> contains what for me is a
<strong>profound insight or claim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Finally, I've previously argued that some people may be "cyberasocial,"
that is, they are unable or unwilling to invoke a sense of social presence
through mediated communication, somewhat similar to the way we invoke
language -- a fundamentally oral form -- through reading, which is a hack in
our brain. I suspect such people may well be at a major disadvantage similar
to the way people who could not or would not talk on the telephone would be
in late 20th century." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-
medias-small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/">Social Media's Small Positive Role in
Human
Relationships</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, I can imagine that when writing was 'invented' and more
importantly I suppose, when writing was becoming accessible to everyone, that
there were those who were bemoaning the loss of story telling and oral
history.</p>
<p>I can imagine that when the telephone started becoming popular (as indicated
in the quote above) there were those bemoaning that we no longer had to visit
together by the fireplace but could just make a phone call.</p>
<p>I myself can remember people who refused to have an answering machine because
they wanted to talk, or refused to leave a message because it was too
impersonal.</p>
<p>But none of those foretold the end of civilization. They were <strong>evolutions</strong>
which enriched and eventually became a commonplace aspect of the way we
interact.</p>
<p><strong>I think that 's a great insight: t</strong>hat being in community or sharing
relationships through social media - to our Facebook friends or mailing lists
or twitter or even sharing photos in Instagram may seem to be taking time away
from our spending 'quality time' together.</p>
<p>But perhaps it's just the next evolution of sharing and relationships - not to
displace what came before but adding a new dimension and a new valuable
dimension to inter-personal relationships.</p>

<strong>thought provoking</strong> and <strong>maybe</strong> good advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.</li>
<li>Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.</li>
<li>Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.</li>
<li>When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.</li>
<li>Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.</li>
<li>Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.</li>
<li>Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.</li>
<li>Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.</li>
<li>Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.</li>
<li>Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.</li>

<p>A good <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-
gamer/8928/">article in the Atlantic about game designer Jonathan
Blow</a>. Interesting quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I continued. “You’ve been chasing some deep form of understanding all your
life, and what I think you’ve found is that questing after that knowledge
brings alienation with it.</p>
<p>The further you’ve gone down that road, the further it’s taken you from
other people. So the knowledge is ultimately destructive to your life, just
like the atom bomb was—it’s a kind of truth that has a cataclysmic impact.</p>
<p>You thought chasing that knowledge would make you happy, but like Tim, part
of you eventually wished you could turn back time and do things over again.”
(<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-
dangerous-gamer/8928/?single_page=true">Atlantic
Magazine</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And read this thought provoking way to represent a fourth spacial dimension
visually. I don't know whether it works but the description makes it sound
quite amazing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well,” ten Bosch countered, “this is what it would be like if there were.”
And that was about the last thing he said that I understood for quite a
while, as he and Blow chatted avidly about extruding surfaces and imagining
flat planes as tubes.</p>
<p>In  <em>Miegakure</em> , two spatial dimensions are constant, and the player solves
puzzles by swapping between the two others with the press of a button.
(<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-
dangerous-gamer/8928/?single_page=true">Atlantic
Magazine</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read the comment thread on the article you see that this guy (Blow)
elicits a lot of negativity because supposedly his games aren't actually that
good, and he's so full of himself. I haven't looked at the games so I can just
go by what the article says, but I liked what I read!</p>

      <h2 id="field-of-dreams-americans-elect"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/05/06/field-of-dreams-americans-elect/">Field Of Dreams: Americans Elect</a></h2>
<p>Americans Elect got Tom Friedman to endorse their effort to get a third party
presidential ballot in November. He wrote about it and convinced me too that
it was a good idea. A month or two ago I started having misgivings and now, it
seems like things are really turning sour for Americans Elect.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/22148/op-ed-
americans-elect-they-built-it-and-nobody-came#.T6Pvbfdd82E.twitter">article in Techpresident.Com </a>paints a
pretty bleak picture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Americans Elect is the best example of the Field of Dreams Fallacy I have
ever observed. The organization spent a reported $9 million building a
cutting edge platform, assuming that high-priced technology and a mainstream
media blitz would result in a centrist groundswell that revolutionizes
American politics. It built no participatory community, and assumed that the
Internet would magically serve one up for them. The result has been an all-
too-predictable failure." (<strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://techpresident.com/news/22148/op-ed-americans-
elect-they-built-it-and-nobody-came#.T6Pvbfdd82E.twitter">Techpresident.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe we didn't understand the dynamics of the web well enough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Maybe, just maybe, this was prove a high-enough profile blunder that we'll
learn something from it about the limits of online politics from it.</p>
<p>The lowered transaction costs of the web help to reveal the true demand
curve for citizen politics. That can prove transformative -- particularly
around issues where there's pent-up demand, but traditionally high barriers
to participation." (<strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://techpresident.com/news/22148/op-ed-americans-
elect-they-built-it-and-nobody-came#.T6Pvbfdd82E.twitter">Techpresident.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that didn't happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That's not the case with voting, however. The barriers to voting aren't
very high. People don't follow politics because they don't like politics.
For issues where no one was particularly motivated, and barriers were
already pretty low, the new media environment doesn't change outcomes.</p>
<p>There is no radical center in American politics. Build the nicest platform
money can buy for a disinterested population and you're still going to be
left hearing the chirp of online crickets." (<strong>from</strong>

<p>On Facebook you may see something like "George Harrison is <strong>watching a video
on Socialcam</strong> " followed by a video.</p>
<p>Beware because if you watch that video by clicking on it, ALL your friends
will now see that you watched it too.</p>
<p>On two occasions in the last few weeks, some pretty <strong>embarassing</strong> videos
were watched by otherwise highly <strong>respectable</strong> people. <strong>Funny</strong>.</p>

      <h2 id="education-strategic-plans-are-they-worth-the-paper-they-are-written-on"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/05/04/education-strategic-plans--are/">[EDUCATION] Strategic Plans – are they worth the paper they are written on?</a></h2>
<p>I came across a very <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strategic-Plan-Neither/128227/">provocative article about why and how universities seem
to often get buried in a time consuming and torturous process of strategic
planning</a>.</p>
<p>My experience in the private sector is that it is <strong>very easy</strong> to get sucked
into a process that takes on a life of its own and sucks a massive amount of
time out of the organization for very questionable outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong> : I don't claim that I have a broad view on this, as my experience
is quite limited but I'll just say that for my money "Strategic Plans" are the
management equivalent of "Big Design Up Front", both of which I try to
<strong>limit</strong> as much as possible.</p>
<p>Remember I am <strong>neither against planning nor design.</strong> I am <strong>against</strong>
spending <strong>massive</strong> resources on the creation of massive documents which are
<strong>out of date</strong> as soon they are written down, and are <strong>never</strong> ever looked
at again.</p>
<p>Here's the conclusion from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This interchangeability of visions for the future underscores the fact that
the precise content of most colleges' strategic plans is pretty much
irrelevant. Plans are usually forgotten soon after they are promulgated.</p>
<p>My university has presented two systemwide strategic plans and one arts-and-
sciences strategic plan in the past 15 years. No one can remember much about
any of those plans, but another one is in the works.</p>
<p>The plan is not a blueprint for the future. It is, instead, a management
tool for the present. The ubiquity of planning at America's colleges and
universities is another reflection and reinforcement of the continuing
growth of administrative power." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strategic-Plan-
Neither/128227/">The Strategic Plan: Neither
Strategy Nor Plan…"</a></p>
