<p>A very interesting article about <a href="http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33677/information_age_volunteerism_open_sourced_crowdsourced">volunteering, and applying the wikipedia
philosophy to
volunteering</a>.
Here he sets the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"People have a <strong>problem with volunteerism</strong> : Now this statement is
<strong>provocative</strong>. It's not said in polite company. We like to think that
we're too busy to volunteer, but it's not true. We don't volunteer because
we don't want to. Why? Either because we don't care enough about giving back
to our communities or <strong>today 's volunteer opportunities aren't suited to
our lifestyles</strong>. Being an optimist, I'm opting for the latter. And so, a
corollary is required:</p>
<p>Volunteerism excludes most of us: Why? Because it <strong>asks us for a kind of
time that few of us can give</strong>. We've got a few minutes while waiting for
the bus to play Texas Hold'em on our mobile phones. We've got an hour to
watch our favorite TV show on a weeknight. And we've got 15 minutes to read
Vogue in the dentist's office. What we don't have is two-plus hours on a
Saturday. That's prime leisure, family, and catch-up time. It's the most
valuable kind of time we've got. It's expensive. <strong>Volunteerism excludes
most</strong> of us by asking for something that's beyond what we're prepared to
give. So we don't."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This rings true to me</strong>. The rest of the
<a href="http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33677/information_age_volunteerism_open_sourced_crowdsourced">article</a>
proposes some ideas on how to better leverage the bits of time people have
that they might be using to volunteer.</p>
<p>Ben then goes on to describe a project that he is working on called <a href="http://www.theextraordinaries.org/">The
Extraordinari </a>which is a really cool
idea.</p>
<p>If you are interested in volunteering and the new dynamics there, <a href="http://www.techpresident.com/blog/entry/33677/information_age_volunteerism_open_sourced_crowdsourced">read the
article!</a>It
is absolutely chock full of background information and links to other
projects.</p>
<p><strong>p.s.</strong> If you have the energy, also read the comments. There are some great
pointers to other resources. I have to say that I feel it is a little
<strong>unfortunate</strong> that this <strong>good post</strong> gets somewhat slammed by some who
maybe don't realize that whether or not these are new ideas, they are reaching
a new audience and putting a new spin on them, and that in itself is positive
contribution that should be applauded.</p>

      <h2 id="who-can-i-believe-about-the-economy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2009/02/08/who-can-i-believe-about/">Who can I believe about the economy?</a></h2>
<p>The problems in our economy right now are real, I believe. Tons of people have
lost jobs, and my investment accounts also prove it. I guess there's no debate
about that. But the question is, what to do about it.</p>
<p>My observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Politicians on both sides are equally passionate yet totally contradict each other about what they claim to be 'facts'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most glaring one is, for me, "are tax breaks stimulative or is government spending stimulative?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean this is a case where apparently intelligent adults are calling the sky red and the grass blue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not like they say, "well experts have trouble understanding this but I really believe that the sky is red and the grass is blue". It's more like, "every single expert out there agrees with me, and if you don't you're a dope."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What to do? Here's where I come out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I don't believe any politician, left or right. They are all lying. Ok, they would call it "framing" but the fact is there are no facts (I am a little more inclined to believe the President, but even there…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that I can't personally determine whether tax breaks are stimulative or not, or whether government spending is stimulative or not, let alone whether either one will 'work'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I decide to believe experts I whose opinion and prescriptions I read in the newspapers and hear on TV. I look for experts who don't have an axe to grind and seem intelligent, thoughtful, and not a shill for one or the other party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may ask, then, what do I read and what do I watch? In the end, the person
who I have decided is making the most sense is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/opinion/06krugman.html?em">Paul
Krugman</a>. He
happens to appear in the papers and tv stations I watch. So I side with his
prescriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A not-so-funny thing happened on the way to economic recovery. Over the
last two weeks, what should have been a deadly serious debate about how to
save an economy in desperate straits turned, instead, into hackneyed
political theater, with Republicans spouting all the old clichés about
wasteful government spending and the wonders of tax cuts." (<strong>from</strong> "<a href="http://">On
the Edge</a>")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Would the Obama economic plan, if enacted, ensure that America won’t have
its own lost decade? Not necessarily: a number of economists, myself
included, think the plan falls short and should be substantially bigger. But
the Obama plan would certainly improve our odds. And that’s why the efforts
of Republicans to make the plan smaller and less effective — to turn it into
little more than another round of Bush-style tax cuts — are so destructive.
" (<strong>from</strong> "<a href="http://">On the Edge</a>")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then in the end I also fall back on the common sense approach: "If you
find that you've dug yourself into a big hole, the first thing to do is <strong>STOP
DIGGING</strong> ". Let's face it, we are in a crisis right now, and we know who was
in charge and what policies were in charge to get us here, so I guess it's
time to try something else.</p>

<p>Dave writes an enthousiastic review of this book: <a href="http://davedupre.com/2009/02/05/the-secret-in-building-26/">The Secret in Building
26</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I just finished reading The Secret in Building 26: The Untold Story of How
America Broke the Final U-boat Enigma Code. What a fascinating read! I’ve
written before about the UK’s contribution to code breaking during WWII
(‘Neglect’ of Bletchley condemned and Bletchley Park Update), but this is
the first time I learned about some of the details of the US contribution. I
always thought the majority, if not all, of the work was handled by the
British, but this book details how it was much more of a partnership between
the British and Americans. Most of this stuff is only recently declassified,
and most is still classified. However, the information available is a great
introduction to the dawn of the electronic computer." (<strong>from:</strong> from <a href="http://davedupre.com/feed/">Big
Dave's Blog</a>)</p>

<p>I've been discovering the mass of information that is created by the
government and is very slowly making its way online. I will be posting my
discoveries from time to time.</p>
<p>The process of making public information available online seems to go
something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Law requires that information be collected and disseminated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People submit forms etc recording such information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others then scan or otherwise process this information and puts it into a database "silo"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The database is put online onto a "silo" web site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other NGOs or agencies then somehow get that data (often by scraping the web sites) and make it API accessible</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems like there may be one or more years between each of these steps, and
that different parts of government move at different rates, in fact right now,
some of the total universe of government information is at a pre-1 stage while
other parts may be at stage 5.</p>
<p>I've been slowly working my way through representative parts of these APIs to
try to come up with a cogent way to describe it (or at least to meta-describe
it, as "it" is constantly changing.)</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, I came across this interesting blog post which has relevance
to this quest:</p>
<p><a href="http://dataspora.com/blog/tipping-points-and-
big-data/">Is Data at a tipping point</a>? In the blog post he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[…]A similar phase transition has already occurred with regards to data
inside business ecosystems. For the past several decades, an increasing
number of business processes– from sales, customer service, shipping - have
come online, along with the data they throw off.</p>
<p>As these individual databases are linked, via common formats or labels, a
tipping point is reached: suddenly, every part of the company organism is
connected to the data center.</p>
<p>And every action — sales lead, mouse click, and shipping update — is stored.
The result: organizations are overwhelmed by what feels like a tsunami of
data.[…]" (from <a href="http://dataspora.com/blog/tipping-points-and-big-data/">Is Big Data at a tipping
point?</a></p>

<p>I read in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123379804164650385.html?mod=hps_us_my_columnists">Personal Technology (Wall Street Journal) today that Foxmarks, the
handy, free utility that synchronizes my Firefox bookmarks between several
computers, now works with Safari as
well</a>.
Great. I tested it, and it does work just fine.</p>
<p>This blog post is being written with another handy firefox plugin called
<a href="http://www.scribefire.com/">Scribefire</a>, which lets me post to my blog
directly from a page in the browser. It works really nicely and I use it
frequently. I recommend it. Unfortunately they don't support Safari yet. So I
am staying with Firefox, for now.</p>
<p>By the way, why am I even considering deserting Firefox? Overall it works very
well and the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-
US/firefox/all-beta.html">new 3.1 Beta 2 seems very fast.</a> There are two areas of discontent:</p>
<ol>
<li>On Mac, the Print dialog box is non-standard, and who cares about that, except that the standard Print dialog on Leopard displays a very useful preview of the pages being printed, something that I frequently miss in Firefox.</li>
<li>For unknown mysterious reasons (I suspect Flash but I don't know) Firefox will go into a frenzy and eat up all my mac's compute cycles. It's annoying when I see my computer get slow, I have to check activity monitor and find Firefox the culprit. I am forced to exit Firefox to get my speed back.</li>

<p>"Building a startup is the most difficult, and most rewarding, thing anyone

are so many things that can go wrong it is a miracle when a startup actually
makes it. It is important to celebrate our successes, learn from our
failures, and value them equally. Failure is important…because success is a
terrible teacher."</p>

<p>I've gotten interested in what is going on in the public sector, in particular
in the world of non profits. I've learned a lot, met many people and been
trying to define a project that would at the same time do something to better
the world as be an interesting and fulfilling product challenge (notice,
missing from that list is "make a lot of money")</p>
<p>I want to start posting some of the cool things I am figuring out but so far I
haven't because I can't really figure out how to organize it.</p>
<p>One area that I have immersed myself into is the many diverse groups who are
doing work promoting government openness and transparency by, among many other
things, creating the technical bridges to allow information that is already
being collected to be more easily accessible. There are many of them, and one
of them is the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>.
They are doing some really cool work, both themselves, and sponsoring and
granting others who share their goals.</p>
<p>Wow what a long wind-up.</p>
<p>Anyway, in digging deeply into their APIs and datasets I decided to learn by
doing and created a Ruby Gem called
<a href="http://github.com/pitosalas/govsdk/tree/master">govsdk</a> with the following
goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A simple and consistent sdk to all the various government (federal, state and local) APIs available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Totally hide from the user of the SDK what those APIs are, what the networking and REST pieces are. Instead provide classes which represent the natural domain objects and behind the scenes accesses appropriate datasets and APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the 'current' best APIs for the various facts and figures so that the user need not do the work to learn each of the organizations and data models. When new ones come online or change, hide that as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide all this in an open source library, for free, with example code, documentation and test suites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 0.0.1 of the GovSdk GEM (0.0.1 -- get the idea?) is implemented and
available at <a href="http://github.com/pitosalas/govsdk/tree/master">GovSdk</a>. Check
it out, but expect it to change because this is still quite embryonic.</p>

      <h2 id="subscribe-to-pandora"><a class="toclink" href="../../2009/02/01/subscribe-to-pandora/">Subscribe to Pandora!</a></h2>
<p>I've known about <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a> for ages, and the last
month or so have been using it again, a lot. It's quite amazing: <strong>constant,
free, music</strong>. Based on your interests.</p>
<p>How does it work? Well just go to <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>, set up
a free account, and indicate, for example, an artist or style you like. It
begins playing songs, one after another which people who've liked what you
like have also liked. You hear a song or artist you don't know, indicate with
a thumb up or down how you like it. That's it.</p>
<p>I have discovered artists I didn't know, rediscovered some that I knew, or
music that I loved and had not heard before. All for free.</p>
<p>One might ask, in a favorite theme of mine, how do they survive? Here is
Pandora one of the most popular sites and applications on the web and on
iPhones, giving it all away. And the artists, how are they surviving? It's a
mystery isn't it.</p>
<p>Well not so much of a mystery. Apparently <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/pandora_on_the_verge_of_closing_shop.php">Pandora came close to having to
shut itself down. No
money</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Founder Tim Westergren has stated that the service is approaching a "pull-
the-plug kind of decision" for the service. Why is this happening? Last
year, web radio giants were hit with outrageously ridiculous fees by a
federal panel for every song that would be played on their stations. This
caused a lot of services to either shutdown, or go through what Pandora has
been experiencing for the past year. In doing so, it seems the financial
problems the music industry has set out to create in order to win the
constant battle between rights, piracy, and copyrighted music, are working.
(from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/pandora_on_the_verge_of_closing_shop.php">Read Write
Web</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just <strong>did what I knew I should do</strong>.</p>
<p>I signed up for an annual subscription.</p>
<p>Yes it cost $36, not that cheap. About what perhaps you might contribute to a
public radio station.</p>
<p>We can't expect that valuable stuff (newspapers? music? software?) continue to
be created by passionate talented people without the prospect of being able
get paid for it.</p>

      <h2 id="what-life-asks-of-us"><a class="toclink" href="../../2009/01/30/what-life-asks-of-us/">What Life Asks of Us</a></h2>
<p>A column in the NYTimes that offers a very different perspective from what we
might think of as the goal of a liberal education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Individuals should learn to think for themselves. They should be skeptical
of pre-existing arrangements. They should break free from the way they were
raised, examine life from the outside and discover their own values." (from
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/opinion/27brooks.html">What Life Asks of
Us</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds very common sense. I found myself nodding in agreement, feeling that
this matched more or less how I saw things. But then he introduces a different
view espoused in a book that came out last summer called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594512965?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=blogbridge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594512965">On Thinking
Institutionally (On
Politics)</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1594512965" /> by the political
scientist Hugh Heclo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this way of living, to borrow an old phrase, we are not defined by what
we ask of life. We are defined by what life asks of us. As we go through
life, we travel through institutions — first family and school, then the
institutions of a profession or a craft.</p>
<p>Each of these institutions comes with certain rules and obligations that
tell us how to do what we’re supposed to do. Journalism imposes habits that
help reporters keep a mental distance from those they cover. Scientists have
obligations to the community of researchers. In the process of absorbing the
rules of the institutions we inhabit, we become who we are." (from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/opinion/27brooks.html">What
Life Asks of Us</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thought provoking. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/opinion/27brooks.html">Read the
article</a>. I am
ordering the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594512965?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=blogbridge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594512965">On Thinking Institutionally (On
