      <h2 id="social-networks-good-or-bad"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/05/15/social-networks-good-or-bad/">Social Networks: Good or Bad?</a></h2>
<p>I've been doing quite a bit of reading about social networks in preparation
for the 2012 edition of my Brandeis University Course, "<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jbs2012cosiwebsocial/">Web and Social
Applications</a>". This
morning I was preparing lecture notes for "Current Issues In Social Networks".
Here are some good current links I have been able to find:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/8930/">Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-medias-small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/">Social Media's Small Positive Role in Human Relationships</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2012-05-14/social-media-and-loneliness">Diane Rehm's Program about Social Media and Loneliness</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?pagewanted=all">The Flight from Conversation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have just come from a family reunion where there were people pulling out
iPhones at 'inappropriate times' and other people debating what has happened
to the art of conversation now that we are all Facebooking all the time.
(Guilty as charged!)</p>
<p>So between the two I have spent some time thinking about this phenomenon and
whether social networks and mobile phones together are a <strong>new kind of
addictive behavior</strong> which is doing real damage to social interactions (that
is, human to human, face to face.)</p>
<p>Or on the other hand, are they just an <strong>evolution of interaction</strong> and
communication and anyone who doesn't see it as an equally valid way of
interacting must be a fuddy duddy. Good question! And I don't really know the
answer, not even what I myself think about it.</p>
<p>But this article by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-medias-
small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/">Zaynep
Tufekci</a> contains what for me is a
<strong>profound insight or claim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Finally, I've previously argued that some people may be "cyberasocial,"
that is, they are unable or unwilling to invoke a sense of social presence
through mediated communication, somewhat similar to the way we invoke
language -- a fundamentally oral form -- through reading, which is a hack in
our brain. I suspect such people may well be at a major disadvantage similar
to the way people who could not or would not talk on the telephone would be
in late 20th century." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/social-
medias-small-positive-role-in-human-relationships/256346/">Social Media's Small Positive Role in
Human
Relationships</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, I can imagine that when writing was 'invented' and more
importantly I suppose, when writing was becoming accessible to everyone, that
there were those who were bemoaning the loss of story telling and oral
history.</p>
<p>I can imagine that when the telephone started becoming popular (as indicated
in the quote above) there were those bemoaning that we no longer had to visit
together by the fireplace but could just make a phone call.</p>
<p>I myself can remember people who refused to have an answering machine because
they wanted to talk, or refused to leave a message because it was too
impersonal.</p>
<p>But none of those foretold the end of civilization. They were <strong>evolutions</strong>
which enriched and eventually became a commonplace aspect of the way we
interact.</p>
<p><strong>I think that 's a great insight: t</strong>hat being in community or sharing
relationships through social media - to our Facebook friends or mailing lists
or twitter or even sharing photos in Instagram may seem to be taking time away
from our spending 'quality time' together.</p>
<p>But perhaps it's just the next evolution of sharing and relationships - not to
displace what came before but adding a new dimension and a new valuable
dimension to inter-personal relationships.</p>

<strong>thought provoking</strong> and <strong>maybe</strong> good advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not feel absolutely certain of anything.</li>
<li>Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light.</li>
<li>Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed.</li>
<li>When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory.</li>
<li>Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found.</li>
<li>Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you.</li>
<li>Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.</li>
<li>Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter.</li>
<li>Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it.</li>
<li>Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool’s paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness.</li>

<p>A good <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-
gamer/8928/">article in the Atlantic about game designer Jonathan
Blow</a>. Interesting quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I continued. “You’ve been chasing some deep form of understanding all your
life, and what I think you’ve found is that questing after that knowledge
brings alienation with it.</p>
<p>The further you’ve gone down that road, the further it’s taken you from
other people. So the knowledge is ultimately destructive to your life, just
like the atom bomb was—it’s a kind of truth that has a cataclysmic impact.</p>
<p>You thought chasing that knowledge would make you happy, but like Tim, part
of you eventually wished you could turn back time and do things over again.”
(<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-
dangerous-gamer/8928/?single_page=true">Atlantic
Magazine</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And read this thought provoking way to represent a fourth spacial dimension
visually. I don't know whether it works but the description makes it sound
quite amazing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Well,” ten Bosch countered, “this is what it would be like if there were.”
And that was about the last thing he said that I understood for quite a
while, as he and Blow chatted avidly about extruding surfaces and imagining
flat planes as tubes.</p>
<p>In  <em>Miegakure</em> , two spatial dimensions are constant, and the player solves
puzzles by swapping between the two others with the press of a button.
(<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-
dangerous-gamer/8928/?single_page=true">Atlantic
Magazine</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read the comment thread on the article you see that this guy (Blow)
elicits a lot of negativity because supposedly his games aren't actually that
good, and he's so full of himself. I haven't looked at the games so I can just
go by what the article says, but I liked what I read!</p>

      <h2 id="field-of-dreams-americans-elect"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/05/06/field-of-dreams-americans-elect/">Field Of Dreams: Americans Elect</a></h2>
<p>Americans Elect got Tom Friedman to endorse their effort to get a third party
presidential ballot in November. He wrote about it and convinced me too that
it was a good idea. A month or two ago I started having misgivings and now, it
seems like things are really turning sour for Americans Elect.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/22148/op-ed-
americans-elect-they-built-it-and-nobody-came#.T6Pvbfdd82E.twitter">article in Techpresident.Com </a>paints a
pretty bleak picture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Americans Elect is the best example of the Field of Dreams Fallacy I have
ever observed. The organization spent a reported $9 million building a
cutting edge platform, assuming that high-priced technology and a mainstream
media blitz would result in a centrist groundswell that revolutionizes
American politics. It built no participatory community, and assumed that the
Internet would magically serve one up for them. The result has been an all-
too-predictable failure." (<strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://techpresident.com/news/22148/op-ed-americans-
elect-they-built-it-and-nobody-came#.T6Pvbfdd82E.twitter">Techpresident.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe we didn't understand the dynamics of the web well enough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Maybe, just maybe, this was prove a high-enough profile blunder that we'll
learn something from it about the limits of online politics from it.</p>
<p>The lowered transaction costs of the web help to reveal the true demand
curve for citizen politics. That can prove transformative -- particularly
around issues where there's pent-up demand, but traditionally high barriers
to participation." (<strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://techpresident.com/news/22148/op-ed-americans-
elect-they-built-it-and-nobody-came#.T6Pvbfdd82E.twitter">Techpresident.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that didn't happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That's not the case with voting, however. The barriers to voting aren't
very high. People don't follow politics because they don't like politics.
For issues where no one was particularly motivated, and barriers were
already pretty low, the new media environment doesn't change outcomes.</p>
<p>There is no radical center in American politics. Build the nicest platform
money can buy for a disinterested population and you're still going to be
left hearing the chirp of online crickets." (<strong>from</strong>

<p>I came across a very <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strategic-Plan-Neither/128227/">provocative article about why and how universities seem
to often get buried in a time consuming and torturous process of strategic
planning</a>.</p>
<p>My experience in the private sector is that it is <strong>very easy</strong> to get sucked
into a process that takes on a life of its own and sucks a massive amount of
time out of the organization for very questionable outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat</strong> : I don't claim that I have a broad view on this, as my experience
is quite limited but I'll just say that for my money "Strategic Plans" are the
management equivalent of "Big Design Up Front", both of which I try to
<strong>limit</strong> as much as possible.</p>
<p>Remember I am <strong>neither against planning nor design.</strong> I am <strong>against</strong>
spending <strong>massive</strong> resources on the creation of massive documents which are
<strong>out of date</strong> as soon they are written down, and are <strong>never</strong> ever looked
at again.</p>
<p>Here's the conclusion from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This interchangeability of visions for the future underscores the fact that
the precise content of most colleges' strategic plans is pretty much
irrelevant. Plans are usually forgotten soon after they are promulgated.</p>
<p>My university has presented two systemwide strategic plans and one arts-and-
sciences strategic plan in the past 15 years. No one can remember much about
any of those plans, but another one is in the works.</p>
<p>The plan is not a blueprint for the future. It is, instead, a management
tool for the present. The ubiquity of planning at America's colleges and
universities is another reflection and reinforcement of the continuing
growth of administrative power." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strategic-Plan-
Neither/128227/">The Strategic Plan: Neither
Strategy Nor Plan…"</a></p>

<p>A SPANISH Teacher was explaining to her class that in Spanish, unlike English,
nouns are designated as either masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>'House' for instance, is feminine: 'la casa.'<br />
'Pencil,' however, is masculine: 'el lapiz.'</p>
<p>A student asked, 'What gender is 'computer'?'</p>
<p>Instead of giving the answer, the teacher split the class into two groups,
male and female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether computer'
should be a masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four
reasons for its recommendation.</p>
<p>The men's group decided that 'computer' should definitely be of the feminine
gender ('la computadora'), because:</p>
<p>1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;</p>
<p>2 The native language they use to communicate with other computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else;</p>
<p>3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible
later retrieval; and</p>
<p>4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.</p>
<p>The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be Masculine ('el
computador'), because:</p>
<p>1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on;</p>
<p>2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;</p>
<p>3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE
the problem; and</p>
<p>4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little
longer, you could have gotten a better model.</p>
<p>The women won.</p>

      <h2 id="education-creative-monopoly"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/04/26/education-creative-monopoly/">[education] Creative Monopoly</a></h2>
<p>An interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-creative-
monopoly.html?_r=1">article by David Brooks in the New York Times commenting on
the views of the always controversial Peter
Thiel.</a></p>
<p>[Why is he controversial? Because he h<a href="http://www.thielfellowship.org/become-a-
fellow/about-the-program/">as a grant program for students who are
so passionate about their startup idea that they are willing to drop out of
college to get the grant</a>. Which is ironic because in the article, Brooks is
citing what Thiel is teaching in his Stanford COURSE!]</p>
<p>The article is about Thiel's views on what and how students get taught in
college:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"First, students have to jump through ever-more demanding, preassigned
academic hoops. Instead of developing a passion for one subject, they're
rewarded for becoming professional students, getting great grades across all
subjects, regardless of their intrinsic interests.</p>
<p>Instead of wandering across strange domains, they have to prudentially
apportion their time, making productive use of each hour." (from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-
creative-monopoly.html?_r=1">The
Creative Monopoly)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would that be bad? Read on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"… We live in a culture that nurtures competitive skills. And they are
necessary: discipline, rigor and reliability. But it’s probably a good idea
to try to supplement them with the skills of the creative monopolist:
alertness, independence and the ability to reclaim forgotten traditions."
(from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/opinion/brooks-the-creative-
monopoly.html?_r=1">The Creative
Monopoly)</a></p>

      <h2 id="new-book-founders-dilemmas"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/04/24/new-book-founders-dilemmas/">New Book: Founder’s Dilemmas</a></h2>
<p>This book looks good: "Founder's Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the
pitfalls that can sink a startup". I came across it in the "Startup Lessons
Learned" Blog, which may be the best blog about leann startups.</p>
<p>This excerpt talks about a common scenario with startups, where the founders
assume that they way they chose to split equity on day 0 will continue to work
for them as time goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How should founders deal with such developments? In short, by assuming when
they do the initial split that things will change, even if the specific
changes cannot be foreseen, and therefore structuring a dynamic equity split
rather than the static splits used at Zipcar, govWorks, and many other
startups. As important as it is to get the initial equity split rightâby
matching it as closely as possible thefoundersâ past contributions,
opportunity costs, future contributions, and motivationsâit is equally
important to keep it right; that is, to be able to adjust the split as
circumstances change." (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/">Founder's Dilemmas: Equity
Splits)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I will be getting the book.</p>
<p><em>p.s. not to be a scrooge, but shouldn 't the title be "Founders' Dilemmas"?</em></p>

<p>If you are a theatre fan I strongly recommend a play I just saw last night.
It's called "Luck of the Irish". From a <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-13/arts/31325980_1_white-
couple-black-homebuyers-lucy">review on
Boston.com:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"… It's one of numerous instances in Greenidge's superb, beautifully
realized new play -- now receiving its premiere in a Huntington Theatre
Company production directed by Melia Bensussen -- that illustrate the
playwright's sure grasp of the nuances of race and class and her insights
into the complexities of human nature." (<strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-13/arts/31325980_1_white-
couple-black-homebuyers-lucy">Boston.Com</a>)</p>

<p>Run, don't walk to see this <a href="http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/2011-2012/The-Luck-of-the-
Irish/">play at the Huntington Theatre in
Boston!</a></p>
