      <h2 id="launch-conference-day-two"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/03/08/launch-conference-day-two/">Launch Conference, Day Two</a></h2>
<p>Yesterday was great. The buzz in the place is unbelievable. This place is the
Launch Conference. Organized and run beautifully by <a href="http://calacanis.com/">Jason Calacanis
(</a>who has become much more warm and fuzzy than I
remember). Here is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-57393002-250/from-scooters-to-
servers-the-best-of-launch-day-one/">Rafe Needleman's summary of day
one.</a></p>
<p>And with all due respect to Boston and <a href="http://www.scottkirsner.com/">Scott
Kirsner</a> in particular, I cannot see a
gathering like this happening in Boston. There just are not nearly enough
interesting startups to pick from. Now, no, I don't claim to know anything
like all of them. I am sure there are lots of great projects I know nothing
about. I am just going by proportions and gut feel. It seems like around every
corner is another incubator and every one is an angel investor or is looking
for one to fund their idea that is going to change the world. It's inspiring
and intoxicating!</p>
<p>Now, on to the show notes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://citybot.com/">Citybot.com</a></strong> - Helps me plan an afternoon in a
city. Based on what I like to do, where I am, whether I have a car or not,
this app helps me construct an plan of where to go and what to do. Like all of
these apps, the key is in how good their content is and so far, all they have
is, predictably, San Fransisco. So a promising but incomplete idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://songspin.fm/"><strong>SongSpin</strong></a> and <strong><a href="http://anthmapp.com/">Anthem</a></strong>
: Two interesting music applications. SongSpin makes a music discovery
service. Songspin produces a 'curated' collection of music by genre and
delivers it as a 'radio station' that you can listen to while online. There
are many services that do this but it's a pretty nice of execution. Anthm is
an app that lets a bunch of people (at a party for example) can
collaboratively control a play list. The music is playing on a computer
running Spotify or a similar app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.license123.com/"><strong>License123</strong></a> - Mundane but powerful. Based
on State, City and type of business, this app will tell me what permits and
licenses I would need to start such a business in that place. Supposedly this
is a tricky and slow (not to mention costly) process. I guess the use of this
app is episodic. I only need it when I am planning to open a new business.
Still very cool!</p>
<p><a href="http://15five.com/"><strong>15Five</strong></a> - Supposedly similar to
<a href="https://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a> according to the judges. This is a way to
gather and respond to status reports semi automatically. Looks very slick.
Depends on the price, because standard emails would work here too. But nicely
executed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://happiily.com/">Happiily.com</a></strong> - A more conventional employee
survey tool. Nicely done. I didn't catch whether they randomly survey a
particular subset of employees so that any particular employee doesn't get
polled too often. Nice survey tool with nice reporting.</p>
<p><a href="http://hunuku.com/"><strong>Hunuku.com</strong></a> - Make it possible or easier to learn
about the family stories and history. You have to get over the normal
awkwardness in asking your mother what your father was like as a young man. Or
why uncle Foo doesn't get along with Aunt Bar. I will try it in my family to
see if it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://hunuku.com/"><strong>Meetcute.com</strong></a> - Based on the appearances match
people up for anonymous rendezvous in local coffee shops and hangouts. The
judges don't like it, but on the other hand they are all 'old' and 'married'.
So basically a user gets to review a bunch of pictures of 'actors' and rate if
they are 'cute' or 'not'.</p>
<p>Based on this two users are sent to a location without knowing who the other
person is or whether they have arrived yet. So you have to get up the courage
to strike up a conversation. It's romantic.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.tolq.com/index">Tolq.com</a> - </strong>Magically translate your web
site, completely into another language. Panel is a bit skeptical that it will
work well enough. Anticipated challenges are: text in javascript; right to
left languages; text embedded in images.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://trustegg.com/">TrustEgg</a> - </strong>Easily create a trust account for
your children and make it really easy to add money to it for them, and have
other family members contribute to the fund. The money is invested in a index
fund or perhaps other choices. I see an analogy with a Charitable Gift Fund
where a big trust is built and allows parents to set up a trust fund in a very
light weight way and without having to set up a trust yourself. Also it makes
it easy to have others (grandparents, uncles, aunts) add funds to it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://offlane.com/">Offlane</a></strong> - Flipboard with offline capabilities.
Even, tweeting while offline. Even searching offline. Even ordering premium
content offline. Will be free to download, with a $5 a month to get the
service.</p>
<p><a href="http://minbox.co/"><strong>Minbox</strong></a> - A new way to access my email designed for
non-techies. Very light weight, and oriented around people rather than
messages. It's a light layer over gmail. It might be useful for people who get
overrun with non-people emails that clutter up their inbox and are a source of
annoyance.</p>
<p><a href="http://goappstack.com"><strong>AppStack</strong></a> - Magically builds a mobile app by
scaling the web for your business phone number, It might work well in the demo
but how well will it work across an arbitrary business?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.couplestreet.com/home">Couplestreet</a></strong> - Facebook for just
two. Not sure.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://gonnabeapp.com/">GonnaBe</a></strong> - Where I am gonna be. Helps people
share what they plan to do to get others to come along. This sounds just like
<a href="http://plancast.com/home/all/everywhere">Plancast</a>. They claim that
Plancast was not as mobile and that Plancast tried to publicize longer term
plans. GonnaBe is focused much more short term. Today, tomorrow, maybe next
week, but that's it.</p>
<p><a href="http://captricity.com/"><strong>Captricity</strong></a> - Given a pile of paper forms this
product does flexible form data extraction. User describes what the fields are
in a form and then extract the data and returning a database with the
extracted data. Demoer says that they 'build a custom oct engine on the side'
to actually process the forms.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://snapt.at/">Snaptat</a></strong> - First of a series of apps built,
essentially, around a Instagram tag. Snaptat is the first, and it appears as a
special purpose Instagram for Tattoo artists. They can create other vacations,
for example for pets, dogs, and so on. They believe they can do another app
every 6-8 weeks for around $10,000.00.</p>
<p><a href="http://fantasypoliticsusa.com/"><strong>Fantasy Politics</strong></a> - A fantasy sports
game built around politics! Baseball cards for politicians. They create a
"power score" for a politician. Kind of 'clout' for politicians, from 0-99.
Sounds cool but I can't find their site.</p>
<p><strong>Upto</strong> - Lets me share events from my calendar with other people that I care
about. You might see that a friend is going to a lecture and decide you want
to go too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trybloc.com/"><strong>Bloc</strong></a> - Claims to let me more easily learn
programming. I don't believe the premise.</p>
<p>-- more to come --</p>

      <h2 id="launch-conference-day-one"><a class="toclink" href="../../2012/03/07/launch-conference-day-one/">Launch Conference: Day One</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.launch.co/">Launch Conference</a> is starting today. It is
descended from many venerable conferences, particularly like
<a href="http://www.demo.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=29414&amp;">Demo</a>. I was a fairly
regular attendee at the Demo conference over the years, and so far, Launch
seems to be continuing that heritage in a very impressive way.</p>
<p>Basically this conference is about Products, Products, Products. Particularly
software and web and mobile products. There's a really good energy in the
room, like the start of another gold rush 🙂 It is overlaid with the usual
Silicon Valley attitude and posturing, but that's ok, I kind of like that.</p>
<p>Each launching company is given 5 minutes to demo/preset their products. There
are 5 celebrity judges who will listen to the demos and then ask difficult
questions.</p>
<p>Here is a running list of products that look good to me. It will be my public
notebook. I hope you enjoy it 🙂</p>
<p><a href="http://ming.ly/"><strong>Mingly</strong></a> - A way to easily remember who you have not
talked to in a while. A useful tool for obsessive networkers (like me) and
something that I have done with a Word file for years and years. Handy, but
it's a business?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.alltuition.com/">Altluition</a></strong> : TurboTax for financial aid.
Very comprehensive solution to help students who are trying to decide what
University to apply based on cost and aid, deciding where to get financial
aid, and then actually applying to multiple financial aid sources. Looks
pretty awesome! (A google for Turbo Tax for Financial Aid, I find this article
about <a href="http://bostinno.com/2011/04/15/harvard-sophomore-founds-aid-
aide-to-help-students-find-financial-aid/screen-
shot-2011-04-12-at-12-25-53-pm/">AidAide</a>. Just shows, like there are no new ideas!)</p>
<p><a href="http://vocre.com/"><strong>Vocre.com</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Video calls with live language
translation. I speak in English. I see the text of my message to make sure
it's correct. I press send and my counterpart hear's my message in, say,
Italian.</p>
<p><a href="http://bud.ge/"><strong>Budge</strong></a>: Gamefication of exercise and other health
related programs and goals. Pushups. Meditation.</p>
<p><a href="https://hadza.com/"><strong>Hadza</strong></a>: Mutiple videos are often taken in different
locations, at the same time, of the same event: a concert, a sports game, etc.
But also a wedding or a place. If you record these with the Hadza application
they create kind of a 'director's console where you can decide what view of
the event you want to see, which audio you want to listen to. This looks very
interesting and cool. They do have to get people to record the video with
their app which is a barrier I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Robin</strong> : Voice activated tool for driver: find parking, check on traffic,
and navigate. Will it really work? Judges debate the defensibility of this
product. "Natural language is the new taxonomy of the web" one of the judges
says. Not sure about the word "taxonomy" here but the point is that there's a
belief that services like Siri will be the entry portal of a most services on
the web.</p>
<p><a href="http://ugrokit.com/"><strong>uGokit</strong></a>: Finding stuff you lost. $1 tag you put in
or with the thing you might lose. It's an RFID tag. There's a reader and an
app. When you lose your charger, watch, wallet, you can use your iPhone like a
geiger counter to locate it. Also making sure that I didn't leave for the trip
without my required items, leave for my gym without everything, and so on.
$150 for the app, the reader and 20 tags. Pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://trigger.io/"><strong>trigger.io</strong></a>: Cross platform mobile product
creation. Allows me to easily create a HTML5, Android and iPhone apps in one
fell swoop. Comparable to <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch">Sensa
Touch</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mailerlite.com/hello"><strong>mailerlite.com</strong></a>: Simpler and cheaper
mailchimp / constantcontact. Looks good. Proof is in the tasting.</p>
<p><a href="http://benetracker.com/"><strong>benetracker.com</strong></a> - Track the beneficiaries for
my estate. like insurance and IRA accounts. When you die (!) they will notify
all the beneficiaries. Ensure that the money caught in estates get to the
intended beneficiary.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lifeyo.com/">lifeyo.com</a></strong> - Really nice, pretty to look at,
alternative to Google Sites or SquareSpace.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://launch.storybricks.com/">storybricks.com</a></strong> - Allows gamers to
create story worlds and MMPG games.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.wanderfly.com/#!start">wanderfly.com</a></strong> - Collaborative travel
planning. It has a very pretty user interface. The recommendations are not
just social, but from 'recognized travel experts. If it works it would be
great, but of course these kinds of sites live or die by the quality of their
content. It's true that TripAdvisor is not all that beautiful to look at but
it's got the content and the quality.</p>
<p><a href="http://zabbi.com/"><strong>Zabbi.com</strong></a> - Some kind of social network which let's
you state what your current emotional state is and allows your friends to
boost your morale when they see you are sad. Cool!</p>
<p><a href="http://preview.moosify.com/"><strong>Moosiify.com</strong></a> - Flirting over music. Match
meets Spotify.com. Meet people because you have similar musical tastes. A very
nice user experience. And they are also creating a Spotify application so that
the counterparts don't have to even have the Moosify client! This is really
interesting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.spacemonkey.com/#/signup">spacemonkey.com</a></strong> - I unfortunately
missed this one but it was so popular among the judges and audience that I
decided to add it to my list. For example, here's what <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-57391989-250/dropbox-
rival-space-monkey-puts-cloud-in-your-house/">Rafe Needleman thought
of SpaceMonkey.</a> To be honest, reading Rafe's
description doesn't impress me that much. I bought a 1Terrabyte disk last year
for $70 from Amazon. Storage is cheap. Why pay a recurring charge?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://thatssuspiciousbehavior.com/">That Suspicious Behavior</a></strong> -
Another one that was popular with the judges that I missed. A way to "See
something. Say something."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hipswap.com/"><strong>HipSwap</strong></a> - Another one that I missed. Buy and
sell your stuff (a la crags list) but they include a pickup and deliver
service.</p>
<p>More tomorrow.</p>

<p><img alt="26GRAYMATTER-
articleInline.jpg" src="https://i0.wp.com/graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/02/26/sunday-
review/26GRAYMATTER/26GRAYMATTER-articleInline.jpg?w=584" /></p>
<p>I saw this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
true.html">article in the Sunday New York Times
</a>today which starts promising but then becomes a bit ridiculous and
makes a <strong>mockery of serious research,</strong> in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>It starts with a claim that sounds plausible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Recent advances in understanding what psychologists call âembodied
cognitionâ indicate a surprisingly direct link between mind and body. It
turns out that people draw on their bodily experiences in constructing their
social reality.</p>
<p>Studies show, for example, that someone holding a warm cup of coffee tends
to perceive a stranger as having a "warmer" personality. Likewise when
holding something heavy, people see things as more serious and important –
more - weighty" (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
true.html">When Truisms are
True)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then as they go into the studies they are doing to demonstrate some of
their ideas. Just casually I think of many simpler explanations than the far
out conclusions they seem to be coming to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For example, we asked 102 undergraduates at New York University to complete
a task designed to measure innovative thinking. The task required them to
generate a word (âtape,â for example) that related to each of three
presented clue words (âmeasure,â âwormâ and âvideoâ). Some
students were randomly assigned to do this while sitting inside a 125-cubic-
foot box that we made of plastic pipe and cardboard. The rest got to sit and
think outside (and next to) the box.</p>
<p>During the task we tracked the number of correct responses suggested by the
students. We found that those thinking outside the box were significantly
more creative: compared with those thinking inside the box, they came up
with over 20 percent more creative solutions." (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
true.html">When Truisms are
True)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Then we asked them to think of original uses for the objects, either while
walking along a fixed rectangular path indicated by duct tape on the floor
(marking out an area of about 48 square feet) or by walking freely as they
wished. The differences were striking: students who walked freely were
better at generating creative uses for the objects â coming up with over
25 percent more original ideas. Such creativity was assessed in terms of
fluency (the number of ideas generated), flexibility (the number of unique
categories that described the generated ideas) and originality (as judged by
independent raters)." (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/when-truisms-are-
true.html">When Truisms are
True)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Really</strong>? It was at this point that I looked back at the article's start to
check if this was Humor or Satire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Kelley</p>
<p>I've had a very bad two days with Comcast, and if you check my account you
will see that I've used Comcast for over 20 years!! But I am now talking to
Verizon.</p>
<p>Because I don't want to waste more time with you guys I will say this: I am
glad to talk to someone serious who wants to know how you are going wrong. I
don't want to talk to a trained support person who is trying to calm me
down. I am very calm.</p>
<p>Here is a short list of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>the web site says that the link is for an email to Rick Germano. This is
clearly not the case as I am talking to you. You treat your customers like
they are dummies.</li>
<li>your voice mail menu is horrible and time wasting. it seems tike it
tries all it can do to avoid me talking to a person. Why even have an 800
number?</li>
<li>it is impossible to call a local office (like the one in Sommerville MA)
to ask if they have a certain thing in stock to save me a trip as the only
phone number is your horrible 800 number</li>
<li>the cable box that you gave me after I had to drive in the snow to pick
it up, was defective. I know that because the second one I drove to the
store in the snow to pick up just worked.</li>
<li>You use your customers as quality assurance instead of making sure that
you don't shrink wrap a boat anchor of a cable box that came from who knows
where to hope it works for the next customer</li>
<li>t is impossible to find on your web site how much dvr is going to cost.
I am forced to call (see complaint above)
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok I could go on but am tired. I know you are trying to save money because
competition is fierce but this is way too far for 2012.</p>
<p>Bye Bye. Pito Salas"</p>

<p>This interesting, and I think, correct <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-
labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">article, makes the argument that the
word 'innovation' is being watered down
</a>and even getting
<strong>cheapened</strong>. It says, about "innovation",</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Regrettably, we now use the term to describe almost anything. It can
describe a smartphone app or a social media tool; or it can describe the
transistor or the blueprint for a cellphone system. The <strong>differences are
immense</strong>." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-
the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">Innovation and the Bell Labs
Miracle)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and leads to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The conflation of these different kinds of innovations seems to be leading
us toward a belief that small groups of profit-seeking entrepreneurs turning
out innovative consumer products are as effective as our innovative
forebears.</p>
<p>History does not support this belief. The teams at Bell Labs that invented
the laser, transistor and solar cell were not seeking profits. They were
seeking understanding. Yet in the process they created not only new products
but entirely new -- and lucrative -- <strong>industries</strong>." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-
the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">Innovation

<p>Excellent points and a <strong>useful distinction</strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="MarieColvin" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.havantchildrensuniversity.co.uk/public/images/logos-
small/sunday-times-logo.gif?w=584" /></p>
<p>In the Sunday Times (of London, I gather, but they don't feel the need to
include that in their name) I saw this outstanding article about what's going
on in Syria. (No I don't regularly read the Sunday Times, I got this through a
link.</p>
<p>Here's a little from the article by Marie Colvin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our house was hit by a rocket so 17 of us were staying in one room,” she
recalls as Mimi, her three-year-old daughter, and Mohamed, her five-year-old
son, cling to her abaya.</p>
<p>“We had had nothing but sugar and water for two days and my husband went to
try to find food.” It was the last time she saw Maziad, 30, who had worked
in a mobile phone repair shop. “He was torn to pieces by a mortar shell.”</p>
<p>For Noor, it was a double tragedy. Adnan, her 27-year-old brother, was
killed at Maziad’s side. "(from <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/news/article874796.ece">The Sunday
Times)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sad postscript is that this article was <a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/MarieColvin/">Marie Colvin's
</a>last, as she was
herself killed soon after in a bombing.</p>
