<blockquote>
<p><strong>David Pescovitz</strong> : Physicians are now removing appendixes by entering the
body through the mouth. The procedure, called Natural Orifice Translumenal
Endosurgery (NOTES) involves the insertion of tools down the throat and
through an incision in the stomach lining. Once the appendix is cut loose,
it's pulled out of the mouth. Apparently, there are other variations of the
technique, including gall bladder removal through an incision made in the
vagina. One big benefit is that these surgeries don't leave any visible
scar. Advocates say NOTES can be performed without putting the patient under
because there are fewer nerves fibers within the body that transmit pain
than on the skin. Recover time is also quicker</p>

post</a> from <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">The
Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This simple utility allows you "to save and restore your window placement
and view options via Window Sets." You can have different Window Sets for
different purposes (e.g. different projects, etc.). Just arrange the Finder
windows as you'd like them and take a snapshot by creating a Window Set;
later you can easily restore these settings through the menubar item
(right). There are also a bunch of window management options in the
Utilities submenu, such as stacking and tiling, etc.</p>

<p>Lately, for some crazy reason, I've found myself, multiple times, in Toronto,
Canada, and Willemstad Curaçao. My Sprint phone doesn't work in either place.
As luck would have it, my Sprint contract is about to expire and so I am
trying to figure out whether I should change carriers.</p>
<p>If you are in the same boat, here are some very handy links that I came
across:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cellularabroad.com/tmobile_intl.html">T-Mobile International Cell Phone Service Information</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cellularabroad.com/verizon_intl.html">Verizon International Cell Phone Service Information</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.cellularabroad.com/sprint_intl.html">Sprint International Cell Phone Service Information</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From reading these, T-Mobile seems to be the right choice for me and where I
live. Do you use T-Mobile? How do you like it?</p>

<p>Here is the full article written by Jeremy Wagstaff…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blind to Bargains<br />
If We Won't Pay for Software,<br />
People Won't Write It<br />
April 20, 2007</p>
<p>Computers would be nothing without programs to run on them, so why do we
spend so much time drooling over our hardware -- physical bits and pieces --
and so little over the software that makes the bits and pieces do what we
want them to? And why are we so stingy about paying for software?</p>
<p>These thoughts were running through my mind the other day as I read the
exchanges on a mailing list devoted to a piece of software I follow closely
(a thought organizer called PersonalBrain, which I'll be taking a closer
look at in a forthcoming column). When its creator, California-based Harlan
Hugh, unveiled the pricing structure of the latest version of the program,
there was a collective intake of breath among users. One, a doctoral student
from Florida, exclaimed: "I stopped breathing for few seconds when I read
the price."</p>
<p>It's true, the jump in price might sound heart-stoppingly steep -- to more
than three times the cost of the previous version. But we're not talking
massive amounts of money here -- $250, in fact, which nowadays wouldn't get
you much more than dinner for two in a posh restaurant. And the people
balking at shelling out are the same ones who are passionate enough about
the software to spend their spare time reading and contributing to a mailing
list entirely devoted to it.</p>
<p>The problem is that we users haven't yet come to terms with what software
really is. We understand hardware -- wires, chips, silicon, more wires --
and can see it and touch it. It isn't hard to attach a value to that. But
software is, well, soft. It's intangible. And we are still struggling to
grasp the fact that hardware is a commodity, and software isn't. Which
leaves software and the people who make it in a constant struggle to both
produce something and find a way of making money from it.</p>
<p>Take Singaporean Joe Goh, for example. Mr. Goh produces a small tool called
FunkeeStory (funkeemonk.com/funkeestory) that does one thing for one select
group of people: backs up SMS text messages from a Treo smart phone to a
Mac. He's been at it full-time for a year now, and is making between one and
three sales a day. He's just about eking out a living, he says, as long as
he keeps costs low. He still regrets an early decision: cutting the price
from $24.95 to $19.95 in the panic of a quiet first week after launching
last year. Even so, he still gets emails saying his tool is too expensive.
"That's when it hit me," he says. "No matter [at what level] I price my
software, there will always be people out there complaining."</p>
<p>All the free software out there puts further pressure on prices. No one
today, for example, is going to pay for a browser, because you can get good
ones free. Part of the blame lies with Microsoft, which has long given away
its Internet Explorer. But the Open Source movement -- where volunteers
contribute to writing software that is then usually made available to users
gratis -- has also contributed with its Firefox browser.</p>
<p>It isn't as if people aren't making money out of software: Microsoft still
charges an arm and a leg for its Office Suite: between $250 and $350 in the
mid-1990s, against $150 to $680 now. Others have switched to different
pricing models. McAfee VirusScan, for example, was a very popular antivirus
program in the mid-'90s, selling for a one-time price of $65. Now people
cough up the same price every year for a subscription.</p>
<p>The rise of Web-based applications that sit in your browser is also
supporting the idea that software should, at least for simple tasks, be
free. Google offers basic word processing and spreadsheet applications
online at no charge, while other companies, like developer 37 Signals with
its collaboration tool Highrise (www.highrisehq.com), offer free basic
versions of Web-based programs and charge for advanced features like storage
or sharing.</p>
<p>I have no quarrel with this kind of innovation. And the more stuff that's
available without shelling out a lot of cash, the better for us as users.
But I suspect that, too, it reinforces a growing perception that software is
an entitlement, something we just grab out of the refrigerator when we need
it. It isn't: It's the lifeblood that flows through the veins of our
devices. We need to recognize that what we get out of our machines is nearly
all due to software, and the brains that created and that maintain it
require food to keep doing so. Sure, the likes of Microsoft probably don't
need every one of us to shell out $600 for Office. But the real innovators
have always been small artisanal developers, beavering away in obscurity and
hoping to make a living. If we keep thinking that software is something that
should be free, then, in the words of Singapore-based software developer
Bernard Teo, we may find that there aren't many of those people around: "If
a developer is not careful, he may find that it's simply not worth his time
building and supporting his product, if consumers continue to expect low,
low prices without limit."</p>
<p>Next time you balk at paying $30 for a program, think about how little that
really is.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/04/26/the-obsolete-
interview/">this post</a> from <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com">BuzzMachine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interview is outmoded and needs to be rethought.</p>
<p>There’s no better demonstration of this than the recriprocal snipes we’ve
been seeing from and around <a href="http://wiredmag.com">Wired</a> magazine from its
attempt to interview people about Michael
<a href="http://techcrunch.com">Arrington</a>. (If you know the tale, skip to the
next paragraph.) See Jason <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2007/04/24/wired-journo-wont-do-email-
interviews-ironic/2#comments">Calacanis’ quite reasonable
effort</a> to respond to Wired writer Fred Vogelstein’s
questions via email and Dave <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/transcriptionErrors.html">Winer’s equally reasonable
offer</a>
to respond in public on his blog. Now see the blunderbuss response from
Wired in a blog post by Vogelstein recounting the email exchange and his
dogmatic rules — “I never do email questions right out of the gate…” — and
also in a blog post from his colleague Dylan
<a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/04/calacanis_wont_.html">Tweney</a>,
calling Calacanis “cowardly” (it appears to be an awkward attempt to be
cute) and in an even <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/04/alist_blogger_j.html">clumsier
attack</a>
from Ryan Singel: “What happens when a top tech figure has an online soap
box, a Silicon Valley-size ego, millions in the bank and a grudge against
the mainstream media?” Arrington <a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=386">piped
in,</a> fearing the fuss would cost him
his publicity. And unable to resist any post about Arrington, <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/silicon-valley-users-guide/interview-
etiquette-255013.php">Valleywag
joined</a> the journalism seminar. Vogelstein — who came to Kofi
Annan agreement to record an interview with Calacanis — emailed me, too, but
I told him I was about to blog about this snit and he probably wouldn’t want
me. Finally, Wired Editor Chris Anderson joined in, saying in a comment on
Calacanis’ blog, “I don’t impose any one policy.”</p>
<p>But maybe, given your vow of <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/12/what_would_radi_1.html">radical
transparency</a>
at the magazine, Chris, you might want to at least impose openness to new
ways, or at least an open discussion about the state of the art of the
interview in the time of the empowered interviewee. A few discussion points:</p>
<p><strong>Who says that reporters are in charge of interviews anymore?</strong> Why should
they set terms? They are the ones who are seeking information. As Calacanis
pointed out in their email exchange, Vogelstein was willing to give up two
interviews because the subjects would not follow his rules. So the story
suffers — it’s less complete, less informative, or less accurate — because
of the reporter’s controlling rules? That wouldn’t make me happy as an
editor, subject, or reader. If you need the information, shouldn’t you be
willing to get it however you can? Isn’t that what reporting is all about?</p>
<p><strong>Are interviews about information or gotcha moments?</strong> Vogelstein said in
his email that he wants phone interviews to get the tone of the subject.
Why? If this is about information, what does that really add? Or is it about
the reporter’s effort to characterize the players in a narrative? Is this
about information or drama? As a subject, wouldn’t you be wary of that? Or
does the reporter want to catch the subject in a slip of the tongue? But
what does that really accomplish? Isn’t it better to get considered,
complete answers? What’s so wrong with enabling a subject to think about an
answer, to review it and get it right before sending it? Isn’t accuracy and
completeness the goal? When I came up in the business, I was taught not to
review quotes with subjects before publication but now I see magazines doing
just that; as Valleywag points out, reporters even negotiate quote approval.
The only reason not to do that is that you don’t want to ruin the gotcha
moment: ‘You said that.’ ‘Well, I didn’t mean it.’ ‘But you said it.
Gotcha.’ ‘But it’s wrong, so can’t we correct that?’ ‘Gotcha.’ We’ve all
misspoken. Should we be able to take back our own words? The only reason not
to is if the reporter believes he has indeed caught us. And there is a place
for catching people (George Allen couldn’t take back “macaca”). But in most
stories, that’s simply not the case, unless your agenda is to get someone.</p>
<p><strong>Too many reporters get too much wrong.</strong> Listen to what both Calacanis and
Winer — not to mention veteran <a href="http://citmedia.org/blog/2007/04/24/interviews-email-or-live/">journalist Dan
Gillmor</a> —
are saying: They’ve been burned when their words in stories end up
incomplete or wrong. Gillmor’s right that reporters should be the subjects
of stories to learn what it’s like to be on the other end of that pen. I’ve
certainly learned that lesson myself.And by making complete interviews
public, as Calacanis insisted, even on audio, we get to check the reporter.
If, again, the goal is accuracy, there’s nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a better way.</strong> Try combining the Calacanis and Winer methods:
Perform the interview in writing, in public. As Winer
<a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/24/transcriptionErrors.html#p4">says</a>:
“So if you want to work together, let’s find a new way to do it. I’m fed up
with the old system. The way we start the reboot is to do all our work out
in the open, real-time. Not via email, but in full view of everyone.”
Examine the possible benefits of this: The reporter asks a question and I
answer it. But I get it wrong and a reader pipes in to give a correction.
Isn’t that a better way? I read my answers as I write them and improve them
myself. What’s wrong with that? Why should the reporter get the opportunity
to rewrite and edit and I don’t? Why should the reporter get to look smarter
than the subjects? The best reporters, after all, go to find people who are
smarter and know more than they do to get the best story. Ah, but I can hear
some of you saying, wouldn’t this blow an exclusive? Well the
<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/04/17/the-value-of-
exclusivity/">exclusive</a> has a fleeting value of about 30 seconds anymore anyway. And
what’s exclusive about what Dave Winer has to say about Mike Arrington? If
anyone owns that exclusive, it’s Dave, no? And Dave’s stance is that if he
has anything to say on a subject, he’ll say it on his blog. Welcome to the
transparent era, my fellow journalists. You want transparency? This is
transparency.</p>
<p><strong>My words are mine.</strong> Enough said.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes need no longer be taken out of context.</strong> Isn’t that the greatest
problem subjects have with how their words are treated? But that need no
longer be a complaint. Why shouldn’t every quote, every snippet and
soundbite, link to its context in the fuller interview? If the reporter has
done a great job on the story, no one need click on those links. But if you
want more or if you want to investigate the context in which this person
said this thing, why not make that readily available, now that we have the
ability, thanks to hyperlinks and permalinks? In fact, doesn’t this change
the very structure of the story? Why shouldn’t that change, too? I’ve been
arguing for sometime that online, there’s no reason to insert the standard
background paragraph when you can link to full background. Ditto for
interviews. Think of the finished story as a summary, a guide to more
information. It may give you everything you want. Or it may link you to
background if you’re new to the tale. Or it may link you to more depth if
you want to dig deeper. Every story becomes a table of contents to
knowledge. Let’s not just reexamine the interview. Let’s reexamine the
architecture of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Interviews and articles need never end.</strong> And never start. A story can
begin with a reader’s blog post: ‘I wish I knew…’ Or it can begin with a
reporter’s blog post: ‘I’m looking at doing a story about ____. What do you
know? What do you want to know? What should I ask? Whom should I ask?’ Who
says the reporters should ask all the questions? Shouldn’t the readers?
Shouldn’t even the subjects (good interviewers usually ask whether there’s
anything they didn’t ask)? Then the interviews can appear online to be
challenged, amended, and corrected by writers, readers, and subjects alike.
Why shouldn’t it be a collaborative effort when it can be? Won’t that only
yield better information? Then the reporter writes a story. Make no mistake:
There is still and always will be great value in that. For the vast majority
of subjects and stories, I don’t want to go digging through original
material and reporting-in-progress. I want the reporter to do the work of
packaging it for me. Absolutely. So the article remains a keystone. But who
says the story should be over then — done, fishwrap — just because the
reporter’s finished writing it? The story is online and as we see every day,
it continues to live and grow as people add their knowledge and perspectives
and corrections via links and comments and remixes of the information. So
the article isn’t a product. It is a process. It is collaborative. It is
three-dimensional, linking to background and depth. It’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, it is a favor.</strong> Vogelstein said in his email to Jason that “no one
talks to me to do me any favors.” Oh, they most certainly do. In our gift
economy, every act of sharing is an act of generosity, a favor. No reporter
or reader should ever forget that. This is the essential human trait that
makes the internet — let alone libraries, newspapers, and magazines —
valuable. Reporters think that they are the ones doing the subjects the
favor and, indeed, that used to be the case and to a lesser and lesser
extent, for some, it still is: The reporter holds the key to the presses and
with the reporter’s choices — ‘I’ll quote you but not you’ — the reporter
grants attention, publicity, legitimacy. Or that’s the way they thought it
worked. But this is the essential lesson of the democratization of media: We
don’t need you and your presses to be heard. Calacanis in his email to
Vogelstein: “Besides I have 10,000 people come to my blog every day–i don’t
need wired to talk to the tech industry.” Winer: “Like Jason, I don’t have
any trouble getting my ideas out on my own.” Or hear the students at
Virginia Tech who got sick of reporters
<a href="http://www.cybersoc.com/2007/04/virginia_tech_b.html">bugging</a> them about
the stories they’d already told on their own .</p>
<p>That should force reporters to reexamine the human economics of the
interview: because they have to and because they can, because the power
dynamics of journalist-subject have changed and because they now have new
tools to do interviews — and articles — in better ways. Why not at least
try?</p>
<p>Vogelstein wanted to talk to me about Arrington. But I didn’t want to talk
to him about that. I wanted to talk to him about this. And I just did it, in
writing, in public. And I hope he talks back and that you will, too. Yes,
news really is a conversation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, elsewhere at Wired, they are trying radical new ways working with
Jay Rosen and <a href="http://newassignment.net">NewAssignment</a>.net on their
<a href="http://zero.newassignment.net/">Assignment Zero</a>. I was interviewed via
email and posted the <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/04/09/my-
assignment-zero-interview/">results</a> immediately, as did the reporter; they also
<a href="http://zero.newassignment.net/assignmentzero/what_questions_should_interviewer_ask_jeff_jarvis">solicited
questions</a>
and wrote
<a href="http://zero.newassignment.net/blog/vivian_martin/apr2007/11/turning_categories_and_interviews_upside_down">about</a>
doing interviews this way. Not a lot of conversation around that because I
was long-winded, pontifical, and boring. But hey, the internet and
conversation are meritocracies. We talk about what’s worth talking about.</p>

<p>I've been setting up a new Windows Vista notebook over the last few days for
use by a non technical user. What a <strong>basket case</strong>. What a disaster. And I am
referring to Vista not the user 🙂</p>
<p>I've been mentally working on a blog post titled either "Has Microsoft Lost
its mojo" or "Has Microsoft Jumped the shark"?</p>
<p>I have encountered multiple absolutely shockingly and incomprehensibly bad
usability issues. I am making a mental list as I go along. Joel on Software
found one and wrote about it extensively: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/11/21.html">read about the design of the "Start
menu" and what it takes to shut down a Vista
computer.</a> But just to
give you a taste, all the documentation calls that thing the "Start" menu,
except the word "Start" doesn't appear anywhere on or near the menu.</p>
<p>But as I say, that's all material for another post.</p>
<p><strong>Last night I had a dream</strong> that I worked at Microsoft and Steve Balmer
singled me out in a company meeting, came up to me (with a printout 🙂 pointing
to the page saying, and "THIS is from YOUR blog…". I think I might have gotten
fired in the dream…</p>

<p>"[snip…]At the Online Politics conference a few weeks ago, Joe Trippi said,
“Every one of these candidates is going to get caught in a macaca moment.”
They will mess up. They will say something in an unguarded moment. Yet we
want them to be unguarded. We want them to be human. So when they are human
and they do mess up, we can’t demand their scalp for every screwup. We have
to judge whether this was merely a mistake or whether it revealed a fatal
flaw in their character. And we need to be make that judgment ourselves, not
under the threat and deadline of the press-conference piranha. We cannot run
politics and the nation by the tyranny of the gotcha moment. I will also
warn of the danger of life in the age of offense.[snip…]"</p>
