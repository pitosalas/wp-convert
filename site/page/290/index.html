<p>Maybe it's because I just arrived from a long drive and stay in New York where
I was guided by the nose by my TomTom GPS lady.</p>
<p>Did you know that the Garmin GPS Lady gets a little annoyed when you choose a
direction different from what is suggested? She says something like:
"Incorrect Route, Recalculating…", which after you hear it two or three times
sounds like "Incorrect  Route, you jerk, you are wasting my time again by
making me do all this work to recompute another route for you. Can't you
listen???" The TomTom lady just suffers in silence and provides you with a new
route as soon as she sees that you didn't follow directions.</p>
<p>Which led me to thinking of a cool feature that none of the GPSs that I've
seen or heard of have. I think it would be differentiated enough that vendors
would put it as one of a few features printed on the front of the box. At any
rate, if that much doesn't come true, at least it would be funny! Here's the
idea.</p>
<p>In addition to picking the voice, as you can today ("American, Female", "New
York Cab Driver", "747 Captain") let me also say what the emotion iis. Could
you imagine:</p>
<p><strong>NERVOUS:</strong> "Oh no, please don't go that way, I can't say what might happen,
but it can't turn out well…."</p>
<p><strong>MOTIVATING</strong> : "Don't worry that you missed that turn. You're a good driver
and I know that you have a good reason to making the change. I am always
impressed with your rapid and effective decision making!"</p>
<p><strong>CASTIGATING: "</strong>You dope, there you go again. I have applied the computing
and data resources of the universe to find you the best possible route. All
you have to do is steer. I mean really, are you totally a waste of space?"</p>
<p>Add your own additional ideas. I think it would sell like crazy and who knows,
reduce driver fatigue and accidents too!</p>

<p>Now I've been a mac for about 4 years now, so I generally don't pay too much
attention to Microsoft's new product releases. But take a look at some of
these videos about Office 2010. There's are some impressive new developments.</p>
<p>I am particularly impressed with the 'backstage view' which appears to pull
together all the functionality that relates to how to get information into and
out of any of the office apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090713/office-2010-revealed-in-
detail-via-microsoft-videos/">One this site, Office 2010 revealed, you will see many cool

momentarily present web site, so Microsoft may force them to be taken down.</p>

<p>Here's an interesting article about how Ruby (the programming language not the
gem) is interpretted or compiled. (It's funny to contemplate what that
question might mean to someone who thinks we are talking about a gem and not a
programming language. 'Is Ruby Interpretted or Compiled' ? Say what??)</p>
<p>Anyway, to whoever is left reading this, I thought this article was quite
interesting: <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/2/15/is-ruby-interpreted-or-
compiled">Is Ruby interpreted or compiled? - Pat
Shaughnessy</a>. Here's a quote to give you a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ever since I started to work with Ruby in 2008, I?ve always assumed that it
was an interpreted language like PHP or Javascript ? in other words, that
Ruby read in, parsed and executed my code all at runtime, at the moment my
program was run. This seemed especially obvious since the default and most
popular implementation of Ruby is called ?MRI,? short for ?Matz?s Ruby
Interpreter.? I always thought it was necessary to use an interpreter to
make all of the dynamic features of the language possible." (from <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/2/15/is-ruby-interpreted-or-
compiled">Is Ruby

<p>About a week ago the new version of the Safari Browser came out for Mac OS X.
I was swayed by the promotion and decided to use it for a while instead of
Firefox 3.5. Here's my take, subjective, not based on a scientific analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Safari 4.02 is faster than Firefox 3.5.1 it wasn't immediately obvious to me. I think Safari starts up a bit faster but other than that, no noticable difference.</li>
<li>The new 'show all my most visited web pages in one screen' feature is pretty, but wasn't useful to me</li>
<li>I was constantly annoyed that Safari would open a new window when all I wanted was a navigation or at most a  new tab. (Yes I did play with the options but none of them fit my mode of use.)</li>
<li>I missed certain plug ins (especially ScribeFire)</li>
<li>The XMarks for Safari feature caused mysterious problems. Not sure whether it was XMarks itself or the plug in management in Safari.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a string on minor annoyances coupled with no special benefit led
me to demote Safari and promote Firefox back to my dock!</p>

<p>In moving my blog to Squarespace 6 I've had a lot of contact with their
support service. They are 'just ok'. Yes, they have the usual boilerplate, "so
glad you contacted us" and "i think I understand why this is important to
you." Ok, ok. Enough cut and paste.</p>
<p>The problem is that they are probably pretty junior and used to answering easy
questions. But when they get at all subtle or maybe even pointing to a bug,
they are lost in the woods and give you useless help. But that's not the
biggest problem.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is that there's no continuity. Each part of the support
email 'conversation' is answered by some random other person. And while they
probably make a good will effort to maintain continuity, it happens constantly
that the new person doesn't understand what came before and gives you a non-
sequitur answer.</p>
<p>Now I have nothing to compare them to, for example, what does blogger.com give
in support (probably nothing) and what does wordpress.com give in support?
(probably nothing.)</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>When you have your best idea ever, <em>always</em> remember that the idea is just 1% of the journey</strong> Yes, ideas are cheap. At least in the world of software engineering and product development, everyone and their grandfather have ideas that may be great. The distance between the idea and the reality is great. <a href="http://www.kaspertidemann.com/steve-jobs-on-the-difference-between-a-great-idea-and-a-great-product/">Here's Steve Jobs about ideas</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When your project is late, <em>never</em> ADD people</strong> Most of the time this will slow you down. The reason is that with each additional person you add to a project you've created that many more paths of communication. If a project is late, adding people to it will make it later. See * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959">The Mythical Man Month</a> by Fred Brooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When planning your time, <em>always</em> allocate at least 20% to learning more</strong> Software engineering, programming languages, libraries, platforms, hardware and software are constantly changing. It take a real sustained effort to keep yourself up to date. What was a good or best practice a year ago may no longer be right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When arguing about a design or a feature, <em>always</em> stop and go ask a user.</strong> Good products don't come from debate around a table, they come from discussion with the actual users. Don't guess, don't argue, go ask! This is known as "getting out of the building".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When planning a project, <em>always</em> work in short increments.</strong> Follow Agile practices, whatever your favorite flavor is, scrum, XP, Kanban, it doesn't matter. Different teams and people like different approaches. And they change and evolve all the time. But there are eternal truths there. Work in small chunks. Even smaller. Even smaller. Don't change many things at once because when your code invariably breaks, you won't be able to tell why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you are spinning your wheels, <em>always</em> stop, think, and only then act.</strong> Google It! The amount of knowledge and down and dirty solutions that you can find on google is infinite. See a strange error message? Google it! And learn how to edit the error message, removing the parts that are specific to you so that you get matches. Or ask on the right forum or mailing list. You need to learn how to ask a question in a way that it will be answered. Make it as easy as possible on the answerer. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you are posting on a technical forum, <em>always</em> formulate the question carefully.</strong> Here are the best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain precisely what you are trying to accomplish</li>
<li>Give a step by step explanation of what you've tried and the result.</li>
<li>Give code samples, links to github accounts, and so on. If the code samples are not brief, create a <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist</a> and put the link in the post.</li>
<li>Include listings of the relevant data, file names, console logs, and versions of various software you use.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you are writing a 'business' email, <em>always</em> follow best-practices</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you expect action, have a single person in the to:</p>
</li>
<li>Know the difference between reply and reply all. Usually don't reply all</li>
<li>The first sentence should state what action you are looking for</li>
<li>Keep it short and sweet. Make it "skimmable". </li>
<li>Know your audience and write appropriately. </li>
<li>Get to the point. Be polite. </li>
<li><strong>When you have to write up a design or a spec, <em>always</em> keep it to a few pages.</strong> Prefer writing short 'stories' over writing long 'specifications. There is no requirements 'phase' to a project any more. Write many short stories and prioritize them relentlessly. If the story is more effort to write than the code, you should be writing the code!.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>When coding, <em>never</em> go beyond the immediate requirement.</strong> Write only the code you need to solve the problem RIGHT now. You might think that this class clearly will need all this methods even though no one is calling them yet. This almost never works out. Don't spend time to set things up for what you'll need in a month. You're usually wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When coding, <em>always</em> wait to optimize until later.</strong> Optimizing too early is one of the cardinal sins of programming. You never know where the bottleneck will be, The thing you think will be slow, will be fast, and vice-versa. Actually you might end up ripping it out anyway!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When your own code mystifies or surprises you <em>never</em> accept that. Dig deeper.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catch yourself engaging in magical thinking.</strong> If it worked yesterday, and not today, then <em>something changed.</em> Similar story as "It worked on my machine, why doestn't it work in production?" Both of these are a symptom of magical engineering thinking. It's just a computer. If the behavior changed, then something cause that change in the behavior. Methodically go through each thing that might be different and, like a scientist (or Sherlock) figure out what it was.</li>
<li><strong>Don 't be satisfied with blind luck</strong> Copying some code without knowing what is going on is not a good idea. Eventually it will come back to haunt you. Be really curious!. If a certain change fixed the problem, investigate until you understand how it fixed the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Learn to Debug</strong> Debugging is a craft in itself. Approach it like a scientist. Don't poke blindly at the code, or solve the problem just by thinking about it. Have hypotheses to test. Do experiments.</li>
<li><strong>When your program blows up <em>always</em> stop and read the error messages.</strong> Catch yourself jumpint to conclusions or seeing what's not there. Fight the impulse that you know what must have failed. Often the right answer is right there in the error message. It might be buried in the middle of a lot of noisy trace output, but discipline yourself to actually read it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you think you spot a code smell <em>always</em> come back and eradicate it</strong> Train yourself to recognize (and HATE) code smells. Like nails on a blackboard, badly designed code should make your stomach turn or your skin crawl.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;%= ir "Never, Ever" %&gt; Cut and Paste code. DRY is a law. If you see any duplicated code it is almost always a bad thing. Look for it and kill it.</li>
<li>&lt;%= ir "Learn how to Refactor" %&gt; This is a fundamental coding skill. When you see non-dry code or other violations, refactor ruthlessly.</li>
<li><em>never</em> leave dead code behind** Delete it.</li>
<li><em>always</em> keep your files, methods and functions short** Depending on the language and the program, the right number may vary. But a method that has more than 20 lines is almost always a serious code smell. A guideline would be 10 lines.</li>
<li><strong>When programming <em>always</em> use a source control system.</strong> It's your safety net. This is especially true when working with other programmers. Learn your SCS tool so you are never reluctant to use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When designing software, <em>always</em> keep concerns as separate as possible.</strong> Design for loose coupling. Pay attention to the Single Responsibility principle. Whether it's a single class or function, a subsystem or module, or a whole system, minimize dependencies. Learn about dependency injection and other techniques for decoupling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When doing object oriented programming <em>always</em> avoid using class inheritence</strong> While tempting, it is almost always better to avoid using inheritence in your class design. It brings undesireable coupling with little benefit that could be had in a simpler way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When programming <em>always</em> use 'intention revealing names'</strong> Chosing the right names for classes, variables, methods is one of the best ways to 'document' your code. Follow your language's naming conventions closely and then create names that reveal your intention. Name things after what they do, not after how they work! Also make sure names are internally consistent. (Ref: <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IntentionRevealingNames">Intention Revealing Names</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When programming, <em>always</em> comment your code, but not too much.</strong> The exact line is a matter of (fervent) debate but it is almost universally accepted that having no comments is a bad idea and that its easy to have too many comments. Keep your comments at the start of each source file, and at the start of each method. Occasionally you might want to put a few lines of comments inline. But that desire often alerts you to a refactoring opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When learning new things <em>never</em> fall in love with the shiny toys</strong> It's ok to be proud in your expertise and trying to perfect your craft. But platforms and languages come and go, and you must remain alert to newer and better ways to solve problems as they are invented. Don't fall in love with a language or platform. It will change and the specific details you memorized will eventually become useless.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these are from books, blogs and my own experience. I will list all the
credits that I can identify but I think in some cases these rules are so
deeply embedded that I cannot recall where I got them from. If you see
sonething that you think you came up with, I appologize!</p>

<p>I've been using mint.com for years now but every month I hate it a little bit
more. It's too big, too slow, and too buggy. But it's solving a problem that I
need solved which is a comprehensive cloud based personal finance tool that
covers banking, investments, credit cards, reporting and analysis. I can't say
that their decline corresponded exactly with when Inuit bought them but… it
didn't help either.</p>
<p>I've wondered why no one is tackling this space. I try them all and they all
are lacking in one key way or another. Here's a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/your-money/household-
budgeting/review-apps-to-track-income-and-expenses.html?_r=0">review from the New York
Times</a> From those,
I've been test driving BillGuard and it seems to have potential but I am not
ready to switch yet. So when I read about
<a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/about-us">NerdWallet</a> I thought, based on the
name, that I had another candidate. I had to search their web site high and
low before I could find a summary of what they do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We create user-friendly tools, crunch numbers and give you all the results,
unfiltered. Across banking, credit cards, education, health care, insurance,
investments, mortgages, shopping and travel, we offer data-driven tools and
impartial information to help you make solid decisions about the money you
work hard to earn. In short, we do the homework so you don't have to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope. Keep looking.</p>
