<p>I've seen several interviews with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Walker_(politician)">Scott
Walker</a>, the
Governor of Wisconsin, about his efforts to 'balance the budget'. I put that
in scare quotes because there's a good case to be made that his agenda is
different or at least well beyond that.</p>
<p>He's very <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/02/21/wisconsin.budget/index.html?iref=24hours">articulate about his position, and quite
convincing</a>.
None of the interviewers had anything to add to the debate other than, "gee
aren't you union busting?" and "gee, how come isn't it good enough that the
unions have agreed to the financial concessions?" And the Governor has very
good answers to each of the obvious questions.</p>
<p>Along comes <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/davidbrooks/index.html">David
Brooks</a>,
as of now, my favorite op-ed columnist in the New York Times (sorry Tom
Friedman, you've been repeating yourself for a while now, and it gets tiresome
to see you constantly try to launch your own memes -- you've been replaced.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/opinion/22brooks.html?_r=1&amp;ref=davidbrooks">David Brooks adds something very interesting and new to the
debate</a>.
Basically his point is that not all unions are alike, and in fact, there's a
crucial and never discussed difference between public sector unions and
private sector unions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[…snip…] <strong>public sector unions and private sector unions are very
different creatures</strong>. Private sector unions push against the interests of
shareholders and management; public sector unions push against the interests
of taxpayers. Private sector union members know that their employers could
go out of business, so they have an incentive to mitigate their demands;
public sector union members work for state monopolies and have no such
interest.</p>
<p>Private sector unions confront managers who have an incentive to push back
against their demands. Public sector unions face managers who have an
incentive to give into them for the sake of their own survival. Most
important, <strong>public sector unions help choose those they negotiate with</strong>.
Through gigantic campaign contributions and overall clout, they have
enormous influence over who gets elected to bargain with them, especially in
state and local races.</p>
<p>As a result of these <strong>imbalanced incentive structures</strong> , states with
public sector unions tend to run into fiscal crises. They tend to have
workplaces where personnel decisions are made on the basis of seniority, not
merit. There is little relationship between excellence and reward, which
leads to resentment among taxpayers who don’t have that luxury.[…snip…]" (

<p>Over the last several months I've been following a series of blog postings by
<a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck </a>on the esoteric and quirky topic
of writing programs to design mazes.</p>
<p>For reasons that are not clear, Jamis developed an obsession with mazes and
has collected a series of articles detailing many different algorithms, their
tradeoffs and concepts and writing them up beautifully.</p>
<p>Today in his <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-
recap">final installment he summarized the
project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last six weeks I documented eleven different maze generation
algorithms. It’s been a blast. I’ve had so much fun researching and
implementing these! It’s been great to see some of you taking my advice and
applying these to learning a new programming language, as well; I really
believe there is a lot of value to be had, there. ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-

<p>This article is called <a href="http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html">"Fact and Folklore In Software Engineering"
</a> and while it is about that, the
part that was more interesting to me was the first section talking about
Scientific Discourse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This article is about why some “facts” refuse to die, and about how to
avoid being fooled by opinion disguised as scientific “fact”. We start,
therefore, with some observations on science and facts." ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html">"Fact
and Folklore In Software
Engineering"</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here he goes on to describe "The messy workings of scientific discourse". It's
clarifying explanation of a process that we understand intuitively but
actually has a rigorous process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bruno Latour is one of the keenest observers I know of the work that
scientists really do, and one of the most punctilious in clearing away the
myths and misconceptions about how science is in fact done. I have found
good use in some of the tools he created to assess the status of an
<em>ongoing</em> debate about a matter that falls within the purview of science,
one that hasn’t been settled - what he calls a
<a href="http://www.demoscience.org/">controversy</a>." ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html">"Fact and
Folklore In Software
Engineering"</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After lots of further interesting detail about this idea, he finally comes
back to the question: "So what is known about programmer productivity?":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We can now circle back to this widely circulated “fact” of the software
profession, according to which “programmer productivity varies by a factor
of 10 (or 5, or 20) between the best and worst individuals”. This is a
remarkable statement, not least because of its implications: for instance,
programmer compensation does not vary accordingly." ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html">"Fact and
Folklore In Software
Engineering"</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this introduction he goes on to thoroughly take apart this concept as
nothing more than unsubstantiated, oft-repeated folklore, based in some really
old, actually inapplicable, and incorrectly cited studies.</p>
<p>But they stick because there is a grain of truth in them. The problem is that
it's just a grain of truth. It's a wonderful article. Read <a href="http://morendil.github.com/folklore.html">"Fact and Folklore
In Software</a>.</p>

test object, one that enables a different style of testing. In this article
I'll explain how mock objects work, how they encourage testing based on
behavior verification, and how the community around them uses them to
develop a different style of testing." ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks aren't Subs by

thing</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[…snip]Morality is like The Matrix, from the movie "The Matrix." Morality
is a consensual hallucination, and when you read the WEIRD people article,
it's like taking the red pill. You see, oh my God, I am in one particular
matrix. But there are lots and lots of other matrices out there.</p>
<p>We happen to live in a matrix that places extraordinary value on reason and
logic. So, the question arises, is our faith justified? Maybe ours is right
and the others are wrong. What if reasoning really is the royal road to
truth? If so, then maybe the situation is like chemistry after all. Maybe
WEIRD morality, with this emphasis on individual rights and welfare, maybe
it's right, because we are the better reasoners. We had The Enlightenment.
We are the heirs of The Enlightenment. Everyone else is sitting in darkness,
giving credence to religion, superstition and tradition. So maybe our matrix
is the right one.[…snip]" ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/morality10/morality.haidt.html">"The New Science of Morality" and it's

    <h2 id="great-article-about-lean"><a class="toclink" href="../../2011/02/01/great-article-about-lean/">Great article about ‘lean’</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-in-a-lean-world/">I recommend this article, "Fatboy in A Lean
World"</a>, (by
<a href="http://www.oreillygmt.eu/author/gordon-guthrie/">Gordon Guthrie</a>) if you
are interested in 'lean' as in Lean Startups, Lean Production.</p>
<p>About why lean production is becoming so hot among us software entrepreneurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great transformation of the industry over the last 10 years has been the
availability of already-written (and battle tested) software which has
slashed the size of a team that can build a functioning product and the
crash in price of hardware. ( <strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-in-a-lean-world/"> Fatboy in a Lean
World</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About Y-Combinator's philosophy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The YCombinator slogan is build things people want. Lean production is the
double negative of that: don’t build things people don’t want. (
<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-
in-a-lean-world/">Fatboy in a Lean World</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About one of the key concepts of lean, the "minimum viable product" or MVP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Like all hot concepts there is a lifecycle of hype. When people realise it
is useful they first start by re-categorising everything they all ready do
as the flavour de jour. Then it blooms and blooms and starts being applied
quite wildly.</p>
<p>An example of this would be the rise of paper prototypes as MVP’s. Paper
prototypes are a great and cheap way of working out design and interface
issues but they need to be tempered with capability.</p>
<p>I could knock up a paper prototype of an iPhone teleportation app and get
great customer stats (‘96% of 14-25 year olds would def-in-et-ely pay $1,000
for this app, right here, right now!’). But without capability it is just
piss and wind.</p>
<p>Patrick Vlaskovits and Eric Ries would define an MVP loosely as ‘enough
product to test a hypothesis’ – and would insist that if it isn’t testing a
hypothesis, then it isn’t an MVP.</p>
<p>I am all in favour of testing hypothesis by the cheapest mechanisms
possible, but my gut instinct is that you probably should not call it an MVP
unless it is a product – a product that you are actually trying to sell,
right here, right now. An MVP, after all, is a Minimum Viable Product. If
your users are not your users (but your product) you should be thinking how
do I get enough users to ‘sell’ to whoever your customers are (lead
generation, advertisers, market information, whatever). ( <strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.oreillygmt.eu/interview/fatboy-in-a-lean-world/">Fatboy in
a Lean World</a></p>

    <h2 id="lies-people-tell-themselves"><a class="toclink" href="../../2011/01/31/lies-people-tell-themselves/">Lies people tell themselves</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington">Michael Arrington </a>is a
famous Tech-pundit-commentator-blogger who recently left or got fired from AOL
because he wanted to be a VC while being a journalist covering the companies
he is investing in.</p>
<p>One way or another that led him and AOL and the super-popular blog he started,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a>, to part ways. All
that is interesting back story.</p>
<p>Arrington recently wrote a very <a href="http://uncrunched.com/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-more-cry-less-
and-quit-all-the-whining/">provocative article arguing that people who
are serious entrepreneurs in serious startups, especially in Silicon Valley,
should be willing to give up their life for work:
</a> Startups are hard. So work more, cry less, and
quit all the whining. Yes he is a genius provocateur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"… You might be sad that you work long hours and that sometimes your boss
yells at you when tensions run high. But you also know that there is nowhere
on earth like Silicon Valley. Nowhere else that is structurally designed to
help you make whatever you can imagine into reality. Nowhere else where
there are so many like minded people who are willing to sacrifice and work
hard to create something new…." ( <strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://uncrunched.com/2011/11/27/startups-are-hard-so-work-
more-cry-less-and-quit-all-the-whining/">Uncrunched</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the usual drivel that is fed to innocents in startups and would hardly
be worth mentioning except that it got a huge reaction (both pro and con) in
the rarified tech geek startup ranks. If you read the article you notice that
Arrington quotes at length from a <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html">Jamie Zawinski who captured his feelings in
a diary from 1994</a>, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I slept at work again last night; two and a half hours curled up in a quilt
underneath my desk, from 11am to 1:30pm or so. That was when I woke up with
a start, realizing that I was late for a meeting we were scheduled to have
to argue about colormaps and dithering, and how we should deal with all the
nefarious 8-bit color management issues. But it was no big deal, we just had
the meeting later. It's hard for someone to hold it against you when you
miss a meeting because you've been at work so long that you've passed out
from exhaustion." ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html">NSCP
Dorm</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You get the idea. Well wouldn't you know, Jamie Zawinski for 2011 is not so
happy about being used to bolster Arrington's article. In "<a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-
to-sell-a-con/">Watch a VC use my
name to sell a con"</a> he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Follow the fucking money. When a VC tells you what's good for you, check
your wallet, then count your fingers. He's telling you the story of, "If you
bust your ass and don't sleep, you'll get rich" because the only way that
people in his line of work get richer is if young, poorly-socialized, naive
geniuses believe that story! Without those coat-tails to ride, VCs might
have to work for a living. Once that kid burns out, they'll just slot a new
one in." ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-
a-con/">Jamie
Zawinski)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might gather that in this case I am more in Zawinski's camp.</p>
