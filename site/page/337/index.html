<p>This is a weird development. Java is a super well established language, why
would Apple decide to stop developing it:</p>
<p>"Apple's <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/21/apple-
discontinuing-java-installation-packages-for-mac-os-x/">announcement</a> that they would be
ceasing future development of their version of Java for the Mac has generated
concern amongst Java developers." ( <strong>from</strong> : <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/22/steve-
jobs-comments-on-apples-java-discontinuation/">Steve Jobs Comments on Apple's
Java Discontinuation - Mac Rumors</a>.)</p>
<p>N.B. Apple is not saying they are ceasing support of Java, but development of
Java. I guess on other platforms (Windows etc.) the Java support and the Java
code provided all comes from Sun/Oracle.</p>
<p>Up to now Apple has been on the forefront of providing a strong Java
implementation on OS X. This presumably was because Apple felt strategically
that they needed to have a strong Java, and that Sun/Oracle would not be
providing it, presumably^2 because the OS X installed base was not large
enough to justify it. So in summary:</p>
<p>Apple previously believed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OS X can't be credible if it doesn't have a strong Java implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sun will think that OS X is not a big enough market to justify the investment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And now Apple believes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OS X no longer needs Java for credibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the tables are now turned, and Sun/Oracle will need to have OS X to be credible going forward.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Interesting…</p>
<p>p.s. I just saw this <a href="http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/entry/steve_jobs_comments_on_apple">blog post where James Gosling comments on Java on Mac
and other recent
developments.</a></p>

<p>Two very contrasting ways of looking at our <strong>relationship with Pakistan.</strong> I
don't know where I stand, to be honest.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the topic you owe it to yourself to <strong>read both
articles</strong> , because I had a hard time finding an appropriate section to quote
in each case.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann--
hari-obamas-robot-wars-endanger-us-all-2106931.html">Here is Johann Hari in The Independent, "Obama's Robot
Wars"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"David Kilcullen is a counter-insurgency expert who worked for General
Petraeus in Iraq and now advises the State Department. He has shown that two
per cent of the people killed by the robot-planes in Pakistan are jihadis.
The remaining 98 per cent are as innocent as the victims of 9/11. He says:
"It's not moral." And it gets worse: "Every one of these dead non-combatants
represents an alienated family, and more recruits for a militant movement
that has grown exponentially as drone strikes have increased." ( <strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-
hari/johann--hari-obamas-robot-wars-endanger-us-all-2106931.html">The
Independent)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, here's a quote from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/opinion/20khalilzad.html?hp">Zalmay Khalilzad in a New York Times
piece "Get Tough on
Pakistan"</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The United States should demand that Pakistan shut down all sanctuaries and
military support programs for insurgents or else we will carry out
operations against those insurgent havens, with or without Pakistani
consent. Arguments that such pressure would cause Pakistan to disintegrate
are overstated. Pakistan’s institutions, particularly the country’s security
organs, are sufficiently strong to preclude such an outcome." (from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/opinion/20khalilzad.html?hp">The New
York
Times</a>)</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/opinion/12brooks.html">article by David Brooks in the New York
Times</a> addresses a
problem that I was wondering about too. New Jersey cancelled the building of a
multi-billion tunnel into downtown New York City. Everyone without exception
says that the tunnel is crucially needed and will benefit New Jersey citizens
enormously. Clearly, New Jersey cancelled the project because it could not
afford it.</p>
<p>I assumed that their position would be something like, we've already laid off
tons of teachers, policemen and so forth, we cannot possibly pay for this, no
matter how important, which seems on the face of it to be a hard to argue with
position. So given that the tunnel is clearly highly desirable and given that
New Jersey legitimately cannot afford it, what's going on? Read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/opinion/12brooks.html">article
by David Brooks in the New York
Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In states across the country, elected leaders raise state employee salaries
in the fat years and then are careful to placate the unions by raising
future pension benefits in the lean ones. Even if cost-conscious leaders are
elected, they find their hands tied by pension commitments and employee
contracts." ( <strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/opinion/12brooks.html">article by David Brooks in the New York
Times</a>)</p>

<p>Here's an insightful <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=all">New Yorker article about
procrastination</a>.
There are some useful ideas and techniques in this article. One of my
favorites is the concept of 'self-binding' (not a form of masochism):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The idea of the divided self, though discomfiting to some, can be
liberating in practical terms, because it encourages you to stop thinking
about procrastination as something you can beat by just trying harder.
Instead, we should rely on what Joseph Heath and Joel Anderson, in their
essay in “The Thief of Time,” call “the extended will”—external tools and
techniques to help the parts of our selves that want to work. A classic
illustration of the extended will at work is Ulysses’ decision to have his
men bind him to the mast of his ship.</p>
<p>Ulysses knows that when he hears the Sirens he will be too weak to resist
steering the ship onto the rocks in pursuit of them, so he has his men bind
him, thereby forcing him to adhere to his long-term aims. Similarly, Thomas
Schelling once said that he would be willing to pay extra in advance for a
hotel room without a television in it.</p>
<p>Today, problem gamblers write contracts with casinos banning them from the
premises. And people who are trying to lose weight or finish a project will
sometimes make bets with their friends so that if they don’t deliver on
their promise it’ll cost them money." ( <strong>from</strong> the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=all#ixzz123hefY84">New
Yorker</a>)</p>

<p>You may not follow the news, but Curaçao is undergoing major constitutional
changes, as are all the Netherlands Antilles. In fact, as of this Sunday, Oct
10, ("10-10-10") the Netherlands Antilles will cease to exist as a legal
entity.</p>
<p>The easiest way to explain this to Americans that I have come up with is, that
it's as if all the islands of the State of Hawaii decided that they should all
be their own state, the state of Oahu, of Maui, etc.</p>
<p>This is from an article in the BBC Caribean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A series of negotiations, with Holland in the role of part partner/part
arbiter, resulted in an agreement in which Curacao and St Maarten will
become ‘separate countries’ with direct ties to Holland.</p>
<p>The three smaller islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba, (the BES
islands) will be incorporated administratively into existing Dutch provinces
in Holland." (from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2010/10/101006_10-10-10.shtml">10-10-10: Why It
Matters</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much to my surprise, no one can find a t-shirt commemorating this big day, so
with my new found graphic design swagger, I decided to design my own. <a href="http://pito.spreadshirt.com/">Get

<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://benlog.com/feed/">Benlog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Barking Dog model is different. You still build fences. Maybe even a
fancy lock. But more importantly, you get a well-trained dog, maybe even two
or three for redundancy. And you assume that some of your fences will fail,
because that’s what fences do when faced with smart intruders. When they do
fail, and someone comes in, that’s where the barking dog comes in. Your
defenses may fail, but your detectors will sound the alarm, allow you to
respond and, hopefully, recover from the intrusion." ( <strong>from:</strong><a href="http://benlog.com/articles/2010/10/06/fort-knox-vs-

<p>Do you love your iPhone so much that you’d want to take it with you in the
grave when you pass away? Famous actor Tony Curtis died last Wednesday and
was buried earlier today in Las Vegas with a few of his favorite personal
items, including his iPhone.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39499661/ns/today-
entertainment/">MSNBC</a>, <em>“Actor Tony Curtis was buried Monday with a melange of
his favorite possessions — a Stetson hat, an Armani scarf, driving gloves,
an iPhone and a copy of his favorite novel”</em>. Now that’s love for the
iPhone!</p>

<p>PART 1: THE ELDERS</p>
<p>Now, such a long time after first contact, it was hard to remember the times,
so much earlier, when the elders had established the borders, such as they
were, of the terrain, such as it was. The elders, The Elders, were no longer
around, or visible even. But their influence certainly was felt.</p>
<p>Yes, their Designees, in uniforms and head gear, were always around, and
apparently in control. But really, they rarely meddled in these small
disputes. Or was it a small dispute? Would it turn into something ugly to be
retold over and over as plans were made for the future?</p>
<p>First contact, in fact, had happened quietly, so quietly, it would have been
easy to miss it. Or did it even happen? The problem lay in the system, or
Method, that the Elders had established, but more of that later.</p>
<p>The first hint of a possible incursion came when, sightless, the outposts at
the extreme edge of the border detected some movement. Now thinking back, you
have to admit that calling it a border is misleading. Each Corpus in turn
would test and nudge to see the resistance that would be met, and the risk
that could be taken. Neither party wanted to escalate, and this is usually the
way detente was maintained.</p>
<p>But in this case, first contact occurred, quietly, while mostly no one was
really paying attention, and while one side was arming and preparing for
confrontation, the other, attending to other matters was unaware until,
suddenly they were. Alarms were sent up the chain of command, and also across.
The diplomatic corps immediately brought into the decision - what was the
recent history of the relationship? The Intelligence (we called it that, but
really it was more like a Defence) branch activated the tactical response
machinery, manned the situation room, and raised, sharply raised, the sensor
scanning across all parts and all borders. And the Legal unit was called up.</p>
<p>Under the rules and traditions, the original intent of the elders, who as you
recall were no longer around, what were our rights under law? Certainly we,
the innocents, would never want to be the ones to have overreacted to an
accidental probe across, lets face it, a vaguely defined border area. More
than vaguely defined, it was disputed.</p>
<p>The elders. Those who came before us, had been confronted with a problem --
far too little land for far too many communities. Yes the communities, each
quite small, were vying for this space. Without a legal framework, anyone
could see there would have been trouble, lots of trouble. The Communities, for
they were not families (sometimes they were,) certainly were loyal to each
other. And they did share with the others a tradition - a sense of higher
purpose and direction.</p>
<p>But other than that they were all over the map when it came to raw force and
power, and the willingness to enter battle, even over seemingly tiny issues.
The Elders saw this and devised a plan which was simple in its concept and fit
well with the physical geography.</p>
<p>As it came to pass, each member of each community would be assigned a minimal
rectangular space: the world became a checkerboard of tiny private plots, and
communities located in different areas with a plot per inhabitant. Orderly,
which was the mindset of the elders, and manageable by Designees, long after
the elders had turned their attention to other matters, other universes, other
planes.</p>
<p>Now, the battle was becoming ugly. First contact had been in the distant past,
and what started as an apparently minor, perhaps even accidental contact, was
threatening to turn into an out and out tug of war. Each side seemed to be
ready to dig in. The Mids (the good guys) were feeling pressure to brace for a
major incursion, a multi-point attack, but in an area that was so remote that
it had been detected late. The Iles (the bad guys) had cleverly used a
distraction caused by the Designees patrolling up and down (as they were wont
to do) to move a major arm of their forces directly into the airspace of their
neighbor.</p>
<p>The three teams, assembled in the situation room, came together in emergency
session. A decision had to be made, in minutes, about how to respond. If
Intelligence, Diplomacy and Legal could not decide, and respond, quickly, the
borders would be redrawn perhaps permanently.</p>

<p>If you know anyone in graduate school (oops, or if you are in graduate school
yourself, or planning to go to one), this is interesting reading: <a href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/jrex/advice-new-
graduate-students">Advice for
New Graduate Students</a> from <a href="http://freedom-to-
tinker.com/rss.xml">Freedom to Tinker</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[Ed Felten says: This is the time of year when professors offer advice to
new students. My colleague Prof. Jennifer Rexford gave a great talk to a
group of our incoming engineering Ph.D. students, about how to make the most
of graduate school. Here 's what she said: ]</em></p>
<p>Those of you who know me, know that I collect quotations as a hobby. (The
short version of the story is that I moved around a lot as a kid. Quotations
are small and very portable, making them a good hobby.) Anyway, two eminent
scientists, Albert Einstein and Lewis Thomas, who were at Princeton the
1930s both have something interesting (and seemingly contradictory) to say
about the role of the individual:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Albert Einstein (physics): "All that is valuable in human society depends
upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual."</p>
<p>Lewis Thomas (medicine, biology, Princeton class of '33): "There is really
no such creature as a single individual; he has no more life of his own than a
cast-off cell marooned from the surface of your skin."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two quotations embody so much of what graduate school is all about.</p>
<p><em>Individual Development</em></p>
<p>First, graduate school is a highly individual experience. Compared to the
somewhat anonymous experience of college -- where you sit in large classes,
do the same homeworks, and take the same tests with many other students --
graduate school is a highly personal. Nobody else is doing quite the same
research you are doing (or at least you <em>hope</em> they are not), and you get
direct (sometimes pointed) feedback on your individual work -- from your
advisor, from your peers, and from reviewers of the papers you submit and
the talks you give. And when your work is good but not great, you don't just
take the A- and move on to the next assignment -- you keep plugging away and
get more feedback and, eventually, you nail it. This is an amazingly
efficient way to learn, grow, and create great scholarship.</p>
<p>Yet, there is a downside. The critique of your work, however well-meaning
and "good for you," will sometimes feel relentless. It requires some
toughening of the skin, and a delicate little dance to simultaneously be in
love with your work (so you have the tenacity you need to always dig deeper)
and yet have enough emotional distance to be able to take constructive
criticism of how your work looks in its early stages. It's not an easy
balance to strike, and I'm sure all of us who do research still struggle
with it. I know I do. This is one of the many ways in which grad school is
as much as emotional challenge as it is an intellectual one.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the "individual" in graduate school is to learn
your research "taste." You may not know it yet, but you are weird. You come
to research problems with some peculiar sensibility that nobody else has.
You are attracted to a certain kind of research problem -- maybe a messy
practical problem, or a sharply formulated (but very hard) theoretical
problem, or something in between. You notice a certain kind of weakness or
gap in other people's research. You have a particular set of techniques or
approaches to solving problems. Graduate school is a wonderful time to
figure out what your "taste" is, so you can craft your own agenda for the
technical problems you pursue in the years ahead.</p>
<p>So, then, graduate school really is the epitome of what Einstein called the
"development of the individual." And I hope during your time here, you get
the kind of opportunities for individual development that you deserve.
Experiences that will let you produce deeper scholarship that expands the
base of knowledge in your fields, and become more accomplished at conveying
new and sometimes complex ideas to others.</p>
<p><em>Part of a Group</em></p>
<p>Yet, for all of my blathering on about the individual, graduate school is
also a collective experience. You are part of a research group, a
department, a discipline, (for many of you) an engineering school, a
graduate school, and student groups like GWISE.</p>
<p>I want to say a few words about your research group, because it is so
important. Your officemates, and the other graduate students around you, are
such an important part of your graduate school experience. Not only do they
provide a sense of community, and a community that truly understands your
experiences, though that is certainly important. But they also mentor you on
topics small and large.</p>
<p>I had a great officemate, Jim, in graduate school. He took ten years to
graduate, and had already been there seven years when I arrived. So, Jim
knew everything about everything. He taught me an important lesson I value
to this day -- how to be efficient. He would sit at the next desk and
admonishingly say, "Jen, I hear the sounds of repetitive keystrokes. Today
you will learn Perl." To be honest, it was kind of creepy at first, but Jim
would watch out for me out of the corner of his eye. He taught me things
that would save me time, leaving me with the time and energy I needed to
tackle bigger and more interesting problems.</p>
<p>Your classmates will also provide wonderful moments of professional
serendipity, random encounters over coffee or foosball that make you aware
of a body of work you didn't know about, or recognize a previously
unappreciated connection between two disciplines. You may even become the
match-maker for the faculty, bringing two professors together to collaborate
because you see a connection in their research that they were unable to see.
The chance encounters, the candid feedback on your research, the unplanned
discussions about research taste and philosophy -- these are all a great
part of interacting with your group mates.</p>
<p>I must caution you, though, about an important enemy against this kind of
informal interactions. The Internet. Okay, so my research focuses on the
Internet, so it may seem strange for me to be so negative about it, but this
is important so I'll make an exception. The Internet makes it far too easy
to work from home, or a cafe, or on the train, rather than in your office or
lab with your peers. Your choice to work away from the office is, in fact,
perfectly rational. Coming into the office has a defined cost, in terms of
your time and (perhaps) having to get out of your pajamas and take a shower.
And, all of this is in exchange for some vague, speculative benefit -- that
you might have a chance encounter that truly changes your research. And,
frankly, in any one day, you probably <em>won 't</em> have a profound experience in
your office, and your officemates may not even be in the same scholarly mood
as you. But, I entreat you to go anyway.</p>
<p>And, I encourage you to have a broader sense of community with each other,
whether in your departments, or the school of engineering, or in groups like
this one. Not only for the professional serendipity -- though that will
happen. But for the friendship and support. Graduate school is fun but it is
also hard, and sometimes frustrating, and having some balance in your life
will make the whole experience more worthwhile.</p>
<p>In fact, for what it's worth, I find the students in my group who are more
engaged with other students and student groups often graduate <em>sooner</em> than
the other students. They often are better at managing their time, working
intensely and efficiently to leave space in their lives for their other
pursuits. And, they are more comfortable reaching out to other students for
help, whether for feedback on a paper or guidance on an analytical technique
or a software tool. They know more about the peculiarities of the faculty,
and how to work around them. And, for the students who are not native
English speakers, the social interactions also have a side benefit of
sharpening their English skills. Mastering a language is, frankly, pretty
boring work. Socializing in English is a much more enjoyable way to learn
the language than any formal study could ever be.</p>
<p>So, in closing, I do think that graduate school is an unusual experience,
both highly individual (in your training and professional development) and
highly collective (in how you are part of a research group, a discipline,
and a larger community). I hope you find both aspects of your time here at
Princeton rewarding, and that you also make time to give back to the next
group of students who arrive at Princeton after you. ( <strong>from:</strong><a href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/jrex/advice-new-
