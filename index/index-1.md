#### Costs exposed: Monorepo vs. multirepo &#8211; Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)


[ Costs exposed: Monorepo vs. multirepo - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)](<
https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-monorepo-multirepo.html>) –In software
engineering organizations, there are certain practices that keep costs under
control even if those seem more expensive at first. Unfortunately, because
such practices feel more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even
when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and
morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags
project completion.  
The reason I say seem and not are is because the alternatives to these cost-
exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the
former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to
infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and
individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.  
To illustrate what I'm trying to say, I'll present three different scenarios
in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past
personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first
one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of
multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up
articles.
