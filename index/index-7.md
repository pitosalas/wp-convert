[ [Solved] Tutorial: GPIO/I2C/SPI-access without root-

gpio-i2c-spi-access-without-root-permissions>)

A great solution to a very specific problem I have been having! -> As you may
have noticed, by default you do not have access to the GPIO-pins, the SPI-bus
or the I2C-bus as a normal user and you have to use 'sudo' to access them or
run an application that utilizes them; it is generally a good idea to limit
access to such things for security, but on a dev-board like the UP and UP^2 it
may be convenient to do development and testing as a regular user.
