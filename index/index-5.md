[ The Basics of Database Sharding - Brent Ozar

#### Sharding your database


[ Sharding your database](<https://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/11/30/sharding-
your-database/>)

I’m increasingly encountering users on Heroku that are encountering the need
to [shard](https://ift.tt/c7m6Yfs) their data. For most users this is
something you delay as long as possible as you can generally go for sometime
before you have to worry about it. Additionally scaling up your database is
often a reasonable approach early on and something I encourage as a starting
point as scaling up is easy to do with regards to databases. However, for the
1% of users that do need to shard when the time comes many are left wondering
where to start, hence the following guide.

Schemes - Dare
Obasanjo](<http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/01/16/BuildingScalableDatabasesProsAndConsOfVariousDatabaseShardingSchemes.aspx>)

OpiniDatabase sharding is the process of splitting up a database across
multiple machines to improve the scalability of an application. The
justification for database sharding is that after a certain scale point it is
cheaper and more feasible to scale a site horizontally by adding more machines
than to grow it vertically by adding beefier servers.

Pose estimation is of great importance in many computer vision applications:
robot navigation, augmented reality, and many more. This process is based on
finding correspondences between points in the real environment and their 2d
image projection. This is usually a difficult step, and thus it is common to
use synthetic or fiducial markers to make it easier.

#### Testing network services in Ruby is easier than you think


[ Testing network services in Ruby is easier than you
think](<https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/testing-network-services-in-
ruby/>)

You’ve started a new project and it’s time for your code to depend on a third-
party service. It could be something like ElasticSearch, Resque, a billing
provider, or just an arbitrary HTTP API. You’re a good developer, so you want
this code to be well tested. But how do you test code that fires off requests
to a service that’s totally out of your control?

#### Deskreen


[ Deskreen](<https://deskreen.com/lang-en>)

Deskreen is a desktop app that turns any device with a web browser into a
secondary screen for your computer over WiFi. Deskreen can be used to mirror
entire computer display onto any device screen that has a web browser. Also
you can limit Deskreen to select only one application window view to share -
very useful for presentation purposes. The best feature of Deskreen is to use
any device as a secondary screen. To have a true extended desktop experience
Deskreen should be used with Virtual Display Adapter. Also with no need for
Virtual Display Adapter you can have a teleprompter with Deskreen using your
tablet or smartphone, for that Deskreen has Flip Screen Mode that mirrors
computer screen in web browser of your tablet (aka. flip screen horizontally).

ROS](<https://medium.com/@amritgupta1999/merging-data-from-multiple-lidar-s-

Light radars or LIDARs are used in robotics, drone engineering, IoT etc. for a
wide range of applications. A typical lidar uses ultraviolet, visible, or near
infrared light to image objects. It can target a wide range of materials,
including non-metallic objects, rocks, rain, chemical compounds, aerosols,
clouds and even single molecules. They are used extensively in building
autonomous systems such navigation, detection, task actuation etc.
