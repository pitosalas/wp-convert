<p>Does Google give a different answer if you reorder the words in the search?
What? A trivial question? Have you ever tried to refine a search by reordering
the words? Wouldn't it be useful if you knew for sure that it would or would
not make a difference?</p>
<p>Experiment:</p>
<pre><code>ruby rails bureaucrat gem examples


rails bureaucrat gem examples ruby
</code></pre>
<p>These two searches indeed did produce different results! And not just a
reordering of the results. There were at least two results in the top 7 which
were present in one and not the other.</p>
<p>Q.E.D.</p>

      <h2 id="vote-buying-measures-and-countermeasures"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2012/10/12/vote-buying-measures-and-countermeasures/">Vote Buying measures and countermeasures</a></h2>
<p>An interesting question, and an expert answer from a friend of mine. If you
are interested in elections and voting and how they can and cannot be bought,
you might find this intriguing. By the way, this scheme would never work in
the US as we have many mechanisms that would prevent that, but these might
apply in other countries that are not as sophisticated.</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say a bad guy made an offer secretly to the population that he would give
each voter $100 for a vote cast for himself. Say they are using optical scan
ballots. Say that cell phone cameras are easily snuck into the polling
booth.</p>
<p>If you were the bad guy, what proof would you ask for so that people
couldn't trick you and collect lots of $100 for votes that they really
didn't cast. And if you were the government or an activist, what would you
tell people about how to trick the bad guy and collect a bunch of $100
bills?:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the Australian ballot, it was easy! Anybody can print a ballot, lots
of straight party ballots printed. You go to your party boss in your polling
place, he gives you a ballot, you put in the box, simple. When the party
bosses were excluded, well, you had to get your ballot from him, and minions
could observe you not getting a different. With some slight of hand you
could trick them, but still very effective b/c most people won't attempt the
slight of hand under threat of kneecapping. The almost as soon as Australian
ballot was adopted (you might get a blank ballot from a government official
in the polling place and mark it in the polling place), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_scan_voting_system">chain
voting</a> was
invented.</p>
<p>Now, today, chain voting is too pesky and low throughput, how about we use
the voter's digital camera in the polling booth! The can take a picture of
the ballot that they marked as instructed by the boss. You show the boss a
picture on your camera, he gives you money and/or spares your kneecaps. But
wait! The digital photo can be faked? Hmmm.</p>
<p>I think that is the stage you've set. There are two main questions. What
methods can the boss put in place to increase the difficulty of faked
photos? What measures can election officials take to make it more difficult
for real photos to be produced?</p>
<p>A separate question, new to me: if you were the government or an activist,
what would you tell people about how to trick the bad guy and collect a
bunch of $100 bills? You bear in mind that it is not just money. The deal
might be this: you show me you voted right and I'll give you money; you
don't show me, and my goons bust your kneecaps.</p>
<p>Well, if I were the gov't, I would be forbidding the use of cameras or
cellphones or any kind of recording device in polling places, rather than
telling people it is OK. Allowing recording devices in the voting booth is
creating the opportunity for vote intimidation. You never want that.</p>
<p>So let me go back to the two main questions. I would suggest to election
officials that ballot marking be done in three sided carrels made of
translucent plastic that will mask a view of the ballot being marked, but
allow a view of the use of recording devices.</p>
<p>There would need to be lots of training both of voters -- we really don't
want you to using recording devices! -- and poll workers to intervene by
asking a voter to please mark a ballot again, because this one you marked
and then did some weird stuff in the carrel that looked like taking a photo.</p>
<p>The boss has a harder time. Clearly a photo of a properly marked ballot
won't do, b/c anybody can make one of those. The photo would need to include
something that showed the ballot and me, together. So probably it should
include my hand as something that should be unique and distinguishing. Maybe
the boss could stamp my wrist with a unique number, in ink that takes days
to wear off. Even so, I could prepare a photo combining a properly marked
ballot, and my hand, but not the ballot that I cast! If pre-printed ballots
are freely available, then I can prepare a photo that the boss expects, but
still vote a real secret ballot in the polling place. I could even make a
fake picture in the voting booth, using a pre-made ballot, but then marking
a real blank ballot and casting that. From there you are in a spy vs spy
sort of games with more boss requirements on the photo, making it more
difficult to fake, but also more difficult get away with in the real voting
booth.</p>

<p>I recently subscribed to the New York Review of Books. Not sure this was a
good decision as the last thing I need is more stuff to read. I came to it
because I kept seeing interesting articles from the NYRB come up on various
blogs and searches.</p>
<p>Here's quite an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098?ie=UTF8&amp;assoc_ss_swlb=1&amp;creativeASIN=0199812098&amp;redirect=true">interesting book
review</a>
of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199812098&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blogbridge-20">Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and
Naturalism</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0199812098" /> ". This sets the tone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the things atheists tend to believe is that modern science is on
their side, whereas theism is in conflict with science: that, for example,
belief in miracles is inconsistent with the scientific conception of natural
law; faith as a basis of belief is inconsistent with the scientific
conception of knowledge; belief that God created man in his own image is
inconsistent with scientific explanations provided by the theory of
evolution. In his absorbing new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199812098/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199812098&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blogbridge-20">Where the Conflict Really Lies:

Naturalism</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0199812098" /> a distinguished
analytic philosopher known for his contributions to metaphysics and theory
of knowledge as well as to the philosophy of religion, turns this alleged
opposition on its head. His overall claim is that “there is superficial
conflict but deep concord between science and theistic religion, but
superficial concord and deep conflict between science and naturalism.” By
naturalism he means the view that the world describable by the natural
sciences is all that exists, and that there is no such person as God, or
anything like God." (from <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/philosopher-

Books)</a></p>

<p>I remember wondering about this when I was in college -- this is before I
really knew anything about computers.</p>
<p>I noticed that our computer center charged by the<strong>minute of processor time
and</strong> it was a lot! I remember people freaking out because their random prime
number generator ran overnight and the department got billed an unexpected
$1,000.00. And they were in trouble!</p>
<p>So it must <strong>cost a lot</strong> to get these computers to do all these calculations,
I thought. So, I asked the local expert, how much does it cost, then, when the
computer isn't doing any calculations? He <strong>laughed</strong>. He said, it <strong>costs the
same,</strong> whether it's calculating or not. How weird.</p>
<p>Here's an interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-
centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?hp">article in the New York Times about the data canters of
companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and many many others, use and waste
a ton of electricity.</a> Here's
the hook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Jeff Rothschild’s machines at Facebook had a problem he knew he had to
solve immediately. They were <strong>about to melt.</strong> The company had been packing
a 40-by-60-foot rental space here with racks of computer servers that were
needed to store and process information from members’ accounts. The
electricity pouring into the computers was overheating Ethernet sockets and
other crucial components." (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-
vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?hp">New York
Times)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But beware, here's something from an <strong>immediate</strong> rebuttal from Forbes, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2012/09/23/why-the-new-york-
times-story-power-pollution-and-the-internet-is-a-sloppy-failure/">
"Why The New York Times Story "Power, Pollution and the Internet" is a Sloppy
Failure"</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So here’s the first problem that requires a clarification if not a
correction. The utilization rates of servers in data centers is cited as
between 7 and 12 percent. Nowhere is it pointed out that this statistic is
derived from IT data centers, not from the state of the art data centers run
by the Internet companies. Huan Liu based on an external model, estimates
Amazon’s EC2 utilization at 7 to 25 percent. But Amazon, Facebook, and
Google, don’t report their utilization rates. It is not accurate to make
this implied association." (<strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2012/09/23/why-the-new-york-

<p>I first came across Sandy Metz in this video:</p>
<p>[vimeo 12350535 w=500 h=281]</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/12350535">2009 - Sandi Metz - SOLID Object-Oriented
Design</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/goruco">Gotham Ruby
Conference</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Object Oriented design you will enjoy this. She is a
wonderful speaker, and fun to listen to. Even if you don't agree with (or
understand) some of the concepts, I promise that you will enjoy listening to
it. Since then Sandy has come out with a wonderful new book which I highly
recommend: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321721330/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321721330&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=blogbridge-20">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer

Series)</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=blogbridge-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321721330" />. You should definitely
take a look at it. I won't even attempt to summarize it but I really love her
writing and how she expresses herself. The writing here is a cut above all the
other techie books I've read recently. I'd go as far as saying that it's
"literate" … whatever that means, exactly!</p>
<p>The book starts with a wonderful expression of "purpose" as an engineer thinks
of it:</p>
<h4 id="we-want-to-do-our-best-work-and-we-want-the-work-we-do-to-have-meaning"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2012/09/23/great-new-book-on-object/#we-want-to-do-our-best-work-and-we-want-the-work-we-do-to-have-meaning">"We want to do our best work, and we want the work we do to have meaning.</a></h4>
<p>And all else being equal, we prefer to enjoy ourselves along the way."</p>
<p>is that not just perfect?</p>

<p>I created this quick and dirty list of useful resources for some friends who
wanted to dig into the latest thinking on web and mobile user interface
design. I am sure this list is incomplete and quirky but I thought it would be
good to share:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've had great luck with Lynda.com courses. It's only $25 per month, and you can watch as many as you like. Here's one <a href="http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/for-developers/52341-2.html">about CSSS for Developers</a></li>
<li>Here's another <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-training-tutorials/279-0.html">to teach you Photoshop.</a> I've actually taken a lot of this one. The author is great.</li>
<li>A famous book with basic concepts on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">How to create usable web sites and apps.</a> It's lessons are universal and timeless. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy--Yourself/dp/0321657292/">Another book by the same author. Probably excellent too.</a></li>
<li>There are tons of blogs and newsletters with interesting UI and UX lessons. This one, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/">A List Apart</a> is pretty well known and has many practical how to articles.</li>
<li>And <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">SmashingMagazine</a>is similarly useful.</li>
<li>This site, <a href="http://www.core77.com">Core77</a>often has good inspirations and photos.</li>

<p>What an antiquated term: Full Duplex. I don't know if that term is used
anymore but what i mean is this:</p>
<p>I use Skype on many many voice calls, either to other Skype users or to
telephone. It seems to me that while the other person is talking, I cannot
interrupt them. In other words, either I am talking or I am listening, but not
both.</p>
<p>Am I mistaken? Or is my Skype set up incorrectly?</p>
<p>Full Duplex is a term that used to mean, maybe still means, that both parties
to a connection can be active at the same time. Last time I used it, it was in
reference to a teletype machine!</p>

<p>Did you hear that <a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com">Google bought Sparrow?</a>
Sparrow is a really cool email client that I for one have been using very
happily for a while now.</p>
<p>Did you hear the announcement that <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google-acquires-sparrow-email-
app-a-trojan-horse-for-google.php">there would be no more development of
sparrow</a>?</p>
<p>Did you hear <a href="http://www.elezea.com/2012/07/sparrow-google-
acquisition/">that some people were upset at this, while others defended
Sparrow's "right"</a> to let themselves be sold? (<strong>Huh</strong>????)</p>
<p>Anyway, I am <strong>not getting</strong> into that discussion. I was <strong>selfishly sad</strong> ,
because I am very fond of Sparrow and I know (from first hand knowledge, more
than once, but also as a customer) that the product that is acquired <strong>doesn
't often do well in its new home, </strong>and so I need to end my addiction to
Sparrow.</p>
<p>But then came the announcement that Mountain Lion (the new OS X for Mac) was
coming out today. I thought I had a theory: Maybe Mail.app on Mountain Lion
would be <strong>every bit as good as Sparrow.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>*Sparrow, seeing the writing on the wall decided better</em>*not to wait</strong> for
the inevitable, and ran into Google's arms. (After all, I can think of many
worse companies to be acquired by.)</p>
<p>For that and other reasons (like impatience) I bought my Mountain Lion ($20
for all three computers -- <strong>good deal!</strong>) First impression: Hmm, what's
changed? Second impression, quick let's go look at Mail.app!</p>
<p><strong>Bad news.</strong> Mail.app is a clunker compared to Sparrow. It's slow to launch
and slow to work with compared to Sparrow. Sparrow works much more nicely with
GMail than Mail.app.</p>
<p>I guess I will <strong>stick with Sparrow,</strong> for now.</p>

      <h2 id="stand-up-no-sit-down"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2012/07/25/stand-up-no-sit-down/">Stand up! No, Sit Down!</a></h2>
<p>You know the old joke that today they say something is good for you, tomorrow
it's bad, and the day after it's good again? Recently there was a lot of press
that sitting 3 hours a day could take years off your lifespan. "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303343404577516853567934264.html">Sitting for
More Than Three Hours a Day Cuts Life Expectancy", so said the Wall Street
Journal:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sitting down for more than three hours a day can shave a person's life
expectancy by two years, even if he or she is physically active and refrains
from dangerous habits like smoking, according to a study to be published on
Tuesday in the online journal BMJ Open." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303343404577516853567934264.html">the Wall Street
Journal</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah but I thought: nowadays, a major part of the economy involves sitting for
more than 3 hours. Start with office work. But add truckers, and pilots, and
other kinds of drivers, people working in many kinds of factories, I mean, are
we all doomed?</p>
<p>Oh <strong>don 't panic </strong>just yet. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444097904577536880563432896.html?mod=djemnumbers_t">"Don't Blame Sitting-Yet-for Shorter Lives", so
said the Wall Street
Journa</a>l
a short while later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Headlines last week suggested that people who spend a lot of time sitting
were in mortal danger. Sitting too long each day could shave two years off
one's lifespan—or, for the glass-half-full crowd, sitting less could extend
life by two years, the media reports said.</p>
<p>The study that led to the news accounts cautioned that no such conclusion
could be drawn from the available research. Sitting studies haven't yet
fully gotten off the ground, thanks to technological, cost and ethical
limitations. Yet the evidence so far all points in the same direction: that
sitting more is tied to higher mortality.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean the act of sitting itself is deadly. Instead, it could
be that people who spend more time sitting are less healthy to begin with,
or that those who sit less are using that time in healthier ways such as
exercising." (<strong>from</strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444097904577536880563432896.html?mod=djemnumbers_t">the Wall Street
Journal</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phew. That's a release. I can <strong>sit down again!</strong></p>

<p>I like this quote:</p>
<p>"Everyone here introduces themselves as an “entrepreneur.” It’s as if they
hand out the title at the airport when you arrive. “Welcome to San Francisco,
you are now an entrepreneur! Which start-up T-shirt would you like?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This belief that everyone is an entrepreneur has a stultifying effect. It
can drive founders to seek an easy acquisition instead of a quest for true
innovation and a sustainable, profitable business — a truly entrepreneurial
challenge." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/disruptions-looking-beyond-
