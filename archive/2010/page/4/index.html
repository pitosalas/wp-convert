<p>This is a weird development. Java is a super well established language, why
would Apple decide to stop developing it:</p>
<p>"Apple's <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/21/apple-
discontinuing-java-installation-packages-for-mac-os-x/">announcement</a> that they would be
ceasing future development of their version of Java for the Mac has generated
concern amongst Java developers." (<strong>from</strong> : <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/22/steve-
jobs-comments-on-apples-java-discontinuation/">Steve Jobs Comments on Apple's
Java Discontinuation - Mac Rumors</a>.)</p>
<p>N.B. Apple is not saying they are ceasing support of Java, but development of
Java. I guess on other platforms (Windows etc.) the Java support and the Java
code provided all comes from Sun/Oracle.</p>
<p>Up to now Apple has been on the forefront of providing a strong Java
implementation on OS X. This presumably was because Apple felt strategically
that they needed to have a strong Java, and that Sun/Oracle would not be
providing it, presumably^2 because the OS X installed base was not large
enough to justify it. So in summary:</p>
<p>Apple previously believed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OS X can't be credible if it doesn't have a strong Java implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sun will think that OS X is not a big enough market to justify the investment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And now Apple believes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OS X no longer needs Java for credibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the tables are now turned, and Sun/Oracle will need to have OS X to be credible going forward.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Interesting…</p>
<p>p.s. I just saw this <a href="http://nighthacks.com/roller/jag/entry/steve_jobs_comments_on_apple">blog post where James Gosling comments on Java on Mac
and other recent
developments.</a></p>

<p>Two very contrasting ways of looking at our <strong>relationship with Pakistan.</strong> I
don't know where I stand, to be honest.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the topic you owe it to yourself to <strong>read both
articles</strong> , because I had a hard time finding an appropriate section to quote
in each case.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann--
hari-obamas-robot-wars-endanger-us-all-2106931.html">Here is Johann Hari in The Independent, "Obama's Robot
Wars"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"David Kilcullen is a counter-insurgency expert who worked for General
Petraeus in Iraq and now advises the State Department. He has shown that two
per cent of the people killed by the robot-planes in Pakistan are jihadis.
The remaining 98 per cent are as innocent as the victims of 9/11. He says:
"It's not moral." And it gets worse: "Every one of these dead non-combatants
represents an alienated family, and more recruits for a militant movement
that has grown exponentially as drone strikes have increased." (<strong>from</strong>
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-
hari/johann--hari-obamas-robot-wars-endanger-us-all-2106931.html">The
Independent)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, here's a quote from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/opinion/20khalilzad.html?hp">Zalmay Khalilzad in a New York Times
piece "Get Tough on
Pakistan"</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The United States should demand that Pakistan shut down all sanctuaries and
military support programs for insurgents or else we will carry out
operations against those insurgent havens, with or without Pakistani
consent. Arguments that such pressure would cause Pakistan to disintegrate
are overstated. Pakistan’s institutions, particularly the country’s security
organs, are sufficiently strong to preclude such an outcome." (from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/opinion/20khalilzad.html?hp">The New
York
Times</a>)</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/opinion/12brooks.html">article by David Brooks in the New York
Times</a> addresses a
problem that I was wondering about too. New Jersey cancelled the building of a
multi-billion tunnel into downtown New York City. Everyone without exception
says that the tunnel is crucially needed and will benefit New Jersey citizens
enormously. Clearly, New Jersey cancelled the project because it could not
afford it.</p>
<p>I assumed that their position would be something like, we've already laid off
tons of teachers, policemen and so forth, we cannot possibly pay for this, no
matter how important, which seems on the face of it to be a hard to argue with
position. So given that the tunnel is clearly highly desirable and given that
New Jersey legitimately cannot afford it, what's going on? Read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/opinion/12brooks.html">article
by David Brooks in the New York
Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In states across the country, elected leaders raise state employee salaries
in the fat years and then are careful to placate the unions by raising
future pension benefits in the lean ones. Even if cost-conscious leaders are
elected, they find their hands tied by pension commitments and employee
contracts." (<strong>from</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/opinion/12brooks.html">article by David Brooks in the New York
Times</a>)</p>

<p>Here's an insightful <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=all">New Yorker article about
procrastination</a>.
There are some useful ideas and techniques in this article. One of my
favorites is the concept of 'self-binding' (not a form of masochism):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The idea of the divided self, though discomfiting to some, can be
liberating in practical terms, because it encourages you to stop thinking
about procrastination as something you can beat by just trying harder.
Instead, we should rely on what Joseph Heath and Joel Anderson, in their
essay in “The Thief of Time,” call “the extended will”—external tools and
techniques to help the parts of our selves that want to work. A classic
illustration of the extended will at work is Ulysses’ decision to have his
men bind him to the mast of his ship.</p>
<p>Ulysses knows that when he hears the Sirens he will be too weak to resist
steering the ship onto the rocks in pursuit of them, so he has his men bind
him, thereby forcing him to adhere to his long-term aims. Similarly, Thomas
Schelling once said that he would be willing to pay extra in advance for a
hotel room without a television in it.</p>
<p>Today, problem gamblers write contracts with casinos banning them from the
premises. And people who are trying to lose weight or finish a project will
sometimes make bets with their friends so that if they don’t deliver on
their promise it’ll cost them money." (<strong>from</strong> the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/11/101011crbo_books_surowiecki?currentPage=all#ixzz123hefY84">New
Yorker</a>)</p>

<p>You may not follow the news, but Curaçao is undergoing major constitutional
changes, as are all the Netherlands Antilles. In fact, as of this Sunday, Oct
10, ("10-10-10") the Netherlands Antilles will cease to exist as a legal
entity.</p>
<p>The easiest way to explain this to Americans that I have come up with is, that
it's as if all the islands of the State of Hawaii decided that they should all
be their own state, the state of Oahu, of Maui, etc.</p>
<p>This is from an article in the BBC Caribean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A series of negotiations, with Holland in the role of part partner/part
arbiter, resulted in an agreement in which Curacao and St Maarten will
become ‘separate countries’ with direct ties to Holland.</p>
<p>The three smaller islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba, (the BES
islands) will be incorporated administratively into existing Dutch provinces
in Holland." (from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2010/10/101006_10-10-10.shtml">10-10-10: Why It
Matters</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much to my surprise, no one can find a t-shirt commemorating this big day, so
with my new found graphic design swagger, I decided to design my own. <a href="http://pito.spreadshirt.com/">Get

<p>"The Barking Dog model is different. You still build fences. Maybe even a
fancy lock. But more importantly, you get a well-trained dog, maybe even two
or three for redundancy. And you assume that some of your fences will fail,
because that’s what fences do when faced with smart intruders. When they do
fail, and someone comes in, that’s where the barking dog comes in. Your
defenses may fail, but your detectors will sound the alarm, allow you to
respond and, hopefully, recover from the intrusion." (<strong>from:</strong><a href="http://benlog.com/articles/2010/10/06/fort-knox-vs-

<p>PART 1: THE ELDERS</p>
<p>Now, such a long time after first contact, it was hard to remember the times,
so much earlier, when the elders had established the borders, such as they
were, of the terrain, such as it was. The elders, The Elders, were no longer
around, or visible even. But their influence certainly was felt.</p>
<p>Yes, their Designees, in uniforms and head gear, were always around, and
apparently in control. But really, they rarely meddled in these small
disputes. Or was it a small dispute? Would it turn into something ugly to be
retold over and over as plans were made for the future?</p>
<p>First contact, in fact, had happened quietly, so quietly, it would have been
easy to miss it. Or did it even happen? The problem lay in the system, or
Method, that the Elders had established, but more of that later.</p>
<p>The first hint of a possible incursion came when, sightless, the outposts at
the extreme edge of the border detected some movement. Now thinking back, you
have to admit that calling it a border is misleading. Each Corpus in turn
would test and nudge to see the resistance that would be met, and the risk
that could be taken. Neither party wanted to escalate, and this is usually the
way detente was maintained.</p>
<p>But in this case, first contact occurred, quietly, while mostly no one was
really paying attention, and while one side was arming and preparing for
confrontation, the other, attending to other matters was unaware until,
suddenly they were. Alarms were sent up the chain of command, and also across.
The diplomatic corps immediately brought into the decision - what was the
recent history of the relationship? The Intelligence (we called it that, but
really it was more like a Defence) branch activated the tactical response
machinery, manned the situation room, and raised, sharply raised, the sensor
scanning across all parts and all borders. And the Legal unit was called up.</p>
<p>Under the rules and traditions, the original intent of the elders, who as you
recall were no longer around, what were our rights under law? Certainly we,
the innocents, would never want to be the ones to have overreacted to an
accidental probe across, lets face it, a vaguely defined border area. More
than vaguely defined, it was disputed.</p>
<p>The elders. Those who came before us, had been confronted with a problem --
far too little land for far too many communities. Yes the communities, each
quite small, were vying for this space. Without a legal framework, anyone
could see there would have been trouble, lots of trouble. The Communities, for
they were not families (sometimes they were,) certainly were loyal to each
other. And they did share with the others a tradition - a sense of higher
purpose and direction.</p>
<p>But other than that they were all over the map when it came to raw force and
power, and the willingness to enter battle, even over seemingly tiny issues.
The Elders saw this and devised a plan which was simple in its concept and fit
well with the physical geography.</p>
<p>As it came to pass, each member of each community would be assigned a minimal
rectangular space: the world became a checkerboard of tiny private plots, and
communities located in different areas with a plot per inhabitant. Orderly,
which was the mindset of the elders, and manageable by Designees, long after
the elders had turned their attention to other matters, other universes, other
planes.</p>
<p>Now, the battle was becoming ugly. First contact had been in the distant past,
and what started as an apparently minor, perhaps even accidental contact, was
threatening to turn into an out and out tug of war. Each side seemed to be
ready to dig in. The Mids (the good guys) were feeling pressure to brace for a
major incursion, a multi-point attack, but in an area that was so remote that
it had been detected late. The Iles (the bad guys) had cleverly used a
distraction caused by the Designees patrolling up and down (as they were wont
to do) to move a major arm of their forces directly into the airspace of their
neighbor.</p>
<p>The three teams, assembled in the situation room, came together in emergency
session. A decision had to be made, in minutes, about how to respond. If
Intelligence, Diplomacy and Legal could not decide, and respond, quickly, the
borders would be redrawn perhaps permanently.</p>

<li>
<p>What was that movie about that we saw LAST WEEK?</p>
