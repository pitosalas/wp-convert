<p>Seems like a dredged up some "old" (you know who you are) <strong>Improv fans</strong> with
<a href="/weblogs/archives/000522.html">my earlier posting</a>, so I thought an
additional comment or two might be in order.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First off, <strong>lest it be misunderstood</strong> , in no way do I feel anything but
totally proud about Imrpov as a concept and a product. I hope it is not
inconsistent to feel that way, and yet agree that for a variety of reason it
was not successful, as a product.</p>
<p>The concept of an alternative (<strong>not</strong> replacement) for a spreadsheet for
real financial modeling is, I think, quite sound. (Yes, I can do page layout
in Microsoft Word, but if that's my purpose, PageMaker is better. You could
make an analogous point about PowerPoint and PhotoShop.)</p>
<p>By the <strong>same token</strong> , if what one is building a real financial model
(i.e. a business plan or an integrated set of financial statements) then a
product like Improv would be far superior. I say like Improv, because that was
over 10 years ago, and it certainly had room for improvement at the time.</p>
<p>I received an <strong>email</strong> from Peter Murray, CTO of a company called
<a href="http://www.quantrix.com/index.php">Quantrix</a>. They have created a new
application called <a href="http://www.quantrix.com/r-section-2.php">Quantrix
Modeler</a> in the spirit of Improv,
which has continued to <strong>improve</strong> and
http://www.quantrix.com/r-section-2.phpthe model. Here is what Peter said of
my posting [slightly edited for length]:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Pito,</p>
<p>I was interested to read your response to Adam Bosworth's talk @ ICSOC'04.</p>
<p>The Improv model is not "ancient history" yet! At Quantrix, we believe
there is significant value in the Improv inspired approach to building complex
models - and our customers are proving that out. There is no question that the
free-form two-dimensional-grid based approach is useful in many cases.
However, as soon as the calculation begins to get complex or the model is
utilized through time in many iterations, our customers find that Quantrix is
a more powerful tool.</p>
<p>Our theory on the reasons for the demise of Improv follow more the line of
thinking in your final paragraph, rather than the idea that the product is
somehow inherently flawed:</p>
<p>1) Lotus was positioning Improv as a spreadsheet replacement, rather than
a specialized tool to better perform an important subset of tasks currently
performed with a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>2) Lotus was in the throes of a heroic battle for survival against
Microsoft's Excel - causing undue pressure on the company to make its product
portfolio clean and understandable, and to organize all resources behind the
flagship product. Introducing new technology costs in a scenario such as that.</p>
<p>Quantrix is employing a patient approach which identifies niches where the
pain on traditional tools is great and the relief from a more scalable,
transparent solution is palpable. As we progress, we are listening to users
and building in new / better functionality - and thus making the product more
attractive to a larger audience. In fact, we have folks from all kinds of
disciplines who have sought out an alternative solution to the traditional
spreadsheet - financial planning / budgeting professionals, equity analysts,
business consultants as well as engineers, scientists and policy researchers.
We even have customers working on genome analysis with Quantrix.</p>
<p>So, rather than ancient history, we prefer to think that - in this case -
"what's old is new again".</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>pete</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And just to close the loop, here is what I responded:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, I agree with that analysis.</p>
<p>Of course, I would hope that the Improv model wasn't ancient history! I
was referring to the particulars of my experience at Lotus. I can be critical
of people who live in the past and relive long past experiences so I am always
careful of that myself. That is a totally closed chapter for me and I wouldn't
have even thought of it until I read Adam's story. My feeling was that at a
very high level he was hitting the nail on the head.</p>
<p>The notion of something being "inherently fatally flawed" seems relative
to me when applied to a product. For example, if I tell you I have designed a
great new televeision but I don't include a screen, well it's fatally flawed.
But if I told you the same thing was a radio, well, you see where I am going 🙂</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">Adam Bosworth's speech</a></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Adam Bosworth's an interesting guy, and very smart, and has been deeply
involved in web services and many related technologies for years. He really
knows this stuff. And it's interesting, because one of the key Web Services
technologies is SOAP, a loosely coupled, "webbish" way of doing remote
procedure calls.</p>
<p>[<strong>Aside #1</strong> : If you feel your eyelids getting heavy around now, I
appologize for not labeling this entry as "GEEK" but I thought it was border
line]</p>
<p>[<strong>Aside #2</strong> : I wonder whether the term "Web Services" is now dated, and
what the more au courant term is. Perhaps "service oriented architecture". If
so, please accept my appologies for not being fully PC]</p>
<p>[<strong>Aside #3</strong> : I see that Aside #1 and #2 are both appologies. I should
have labeled them Applogogy #1 and #2. I appologize.]</p>
<p>Anyway, if you've followed SOAP and the related and simpler standard known
as XML-RPC you will have noticed a big difference, particularly in the degree
of complexity in each scheme. And by the way, SOAP has spawned a whole series
of related formats or standards, one more complicated than the one before it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Adam Bosworth, closely connected to the origins of SOAP, <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">in this
speech gives an
</a>empassioned plea for what
we know as the "KISS" principle. Where I went to school, KISS stood for "Keep
it Simple Stupid" (yes, I didn't get out much 🙂 but Adam Bosworth uses to mean
Keep it Simple and Sloppy.</p>
<p>This argument about how simple is too simple is an important (and not new)
one in our field. <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">Adam Bosworth's
article</a> is a good piece
because it collects together many of the traditional points as well as clever
phrases which are used in this debate which we see in our field in many
different guises, and it makes you think.</p>
<p>I don't have the answer or really a clear opinion. You can rattle off
standards / protocols / formats / languages which are easy to understand (for
example <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS 2.0</a>) and explain and
those which are thoroughly inscrutable and confusing (for example <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/">XML
Encryption</a>.)</p>
<p>I could cite a dozen <strong>other examples</strong> , but I won't.</p>
<p>When I say I don't really have an answer or clear opinion, here's the
reason.</p>
<p>When I read something like the XML Encryption standard, I get totally lost.
My default conclusion is that it's just over my head, and whoever designed it
understood the the subject matter better than I, and I just am thankful for
good libraries to call. But on the other hand, I have seen plenty of examples
of totally overengineered systems and architectures to know that unnecessary
complexity is definitely a disease that inflicts us in this field.</p>
<p>So I am not ready to say one way or the other that simpler is always
better, or that one approach (for example SOAP) is clearly inferior to another
one (for example XML-RPC.) <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">Adam Bosworth's
piece</a> won't answer this
question, but it is thought provoking (as you can see, because it provoked me
to write this little piece)</p>

      <h2 id="why-improv-didnt-succeed"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2004/11/29/why-improv-didnt-succeed/">Why Improv didn’t succeed</a></h2>
<p>It's been a while.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is why my heart beat just a <strong>little faster</strong> when I read a reference
to Improv (not altogether flattering) in the <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000031.html">Adam Bossworth piece
</a>I just wrote about, where
he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_<br />
Consider the<strong>spreadsheet</strong>. It is a protean, sloppy, plastic, flexible
medium that is, ironically, the despair of all accountants and auditors
because it is virtually impossible to reliably understand a truly complex
and rich spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>Lotus corporation (now IBM), filled with <strong>Harvard MBA 's and PhD's in CS
</strong>from MIT, built Improv. Improv set out "to fix all this". It was an auditors
dream. It provided rarified heights of abstraction, formalisms for rows and
columns, and in short was truly comprehensible. It <strong>failed utterly</strong> , not
because it failed in its ambitions but because it succeeded._</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I happen to know <strong>a little bit</strong> about this 🙂 <strong>I was the guy</strong> , for
better or worse, who came up with the idea for <strong>Improv</strong> and got it built and
shipped at Lotus.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying I have neither a PhD nor an MBA (and proud of it!)
And I am almost positive there was not a single one of those on the Improv
team. But other than that, Adam makes I think an <strong>important</strong> and accurate
observation.</p>
<p>This is so many years ago now so I don't think about it much anymore. But
at one point I was often asked and thought about what happened with Improv and
why it failed. And while I had more complicated answers at the time, I have to
say that <strong>there is a lot</strong> to what Adam says.</p>
<p>It's easy to get all philosophical about what makes a spreadsheet a
spreadsheet, what it's core essence is. And I have. It's hard to argue that
one of the keys is the maleability of the spreadsheet as a medium. The fact
that a spreadsheet can grow organically, be modified and grown in a kind of an
Improvisational manner. But when spreadsheets get <strong>complicated</strong> they get
messy and error-prone and this is what Improv set out to address.</p>
<p>In the end it didn't go anywhere, probably because in setting out to
improve on spreadsheets, Improv lost the essence of a spreadsheet and in doing
so <strong>lost the market</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Innovators Dilemma</strong></p>
<p>There is an interesting Innovators Dilemma kind of perspective here,
referring to the now-classic book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0875845851/002-1504404-5645600?v=glance">"The Innovators Dilemma" by Clayton M.
Christensen</a>.
To summarize one of the key theses of the book extremely briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>that a new technology might initially have a fatal flaw which makes it
unsuitable for the purpose it was intended for. (For example, Electric cars
don't have the range or speed to meet the needs of today's drivers.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An established maker of cars (e.g. Ford) has a strong disincentive to
invest in Electric cars because it doesn't meet the need of it's existing
customer base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An upstart competitor could identify a different market where the
apparent flaws (speed and range) are actually 'features' not 'bugs' (for
example a car specifically made for very young drivers) and use that market as
a spring board to be able to perfect the technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually the upstart has years of experience with the new technology
(the batteries and drive train) and improves it to the point where it actually
does meet the need of mainstream customers, while the established player has
been ignoring things and gets unseated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am <strong>not sure</strong> it applies, but one could argue a parallel here with
Improv. In particular this would lead you to the conclusion that the key
strategy <strong>mistake</strong> was to try to market Improv to the existing spreadsheet
market. Instead, if the product were marketed to a segment where the more
structured model was a 'feature' not a 'bug' would have given Lotus the time
to learn and improve and refine the model to a point where it would have
<strong>satisfied</strong> the larger market as well.</p>
<p>Who knows. Ancient history.</p>

<p>I just <a href="http://www.portalsmag.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=6159">came across a good
summary</a> on
one of our favorite topics from KM Magazine. It was written by <a href="http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/">Bill Ives of
Portals and KM fame:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>" Blogs are both a technology and a way of communicating. On the one
hand, they are nothing more than simple Web sites, often published in the form
of a journal, that provide original content, links to other relevant content,
simple editing features, comment capability, archiving, search, and security
options. This ease of use provides a vehicle for the writer's unedited
personal voice, which is considered a defining aspect of blogs. While many
uses beyond personal journalism have emerged, the individual voice remains a
central characteristic, even in the corporate setting."</em></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.xandocosi.com/images/CosiMap2.gif?w=584" /> Have you
seen this <strong>map</strong> before? Yes?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Actually</strong> it's the map of states where the <a href="http://www.xandocosi.com/">Cosi Restaurant
</a>chain <a href="http://www.xandocosi.com/locator.html">has
stores</a>. I don't know what it means,
but I thought it must mean <strong>something</strong>. Amusing.</p>
<p>(from a private mailing list I am on)</p>
<p>[<strong>Note to those who don 't obsessively follow US Politics and culture:
</strong>the map above looks a lot like the map showing U.S. states where the
Democratic candidate for president won in blue and where the Republican
candidate for president won in red. However the map actually shows where a
certain sandwhich restaurant chain has stores. The relation between the two is
a mystery to me too.]</p>

<p>My answer to the question: <strong>" What is a Blog", </strong>which I get asked often,
goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"A blog is a just a web site with articles or notes that get posted there,
generally by a single person. There's nothing especially new or complex about
the technology of blogs. What's new and compelling is the <strong>blogging
phenomenon</strong> : For whatever reason, individuals with unique and important
points of view are <strong>choosing to publish</strong> those in blogs."</p>
<p>Actually <strong>the point of this post</strong> is to point you <a href="http://www.kevinsites.net/2004_11_21_archive.html#110107420331292115">this great and I would
almost say <strong>moving</strong> account by Kevin
Sites</a>,
keeper of <a href="http://www.kevinsites.net/">a photo blog</a> that was very active
and interesting earlier this year and the year before.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kevinsites.net/">Kevin Sites</a> is a reporter who has been
covering the Iraq war from the inside. You might have heard about the video
tape of a marine shooting a prisoner which has made quite an uproar both here
and in the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is, to me, amazing to be able to read, in Kevin Sites own words, what he
saw, what he thought about it at the time and now, and how it has unfolded for
him.</p>

      <h2 id="new-blogbridge-alpha"><a class="toclink" href="../../../../2004/11/20/new-blogbridge-alpha/">New BlogBridge Alpha</a></h2>
<p>Hey, sorry if you aren't a BlogBridge user yet, but I just can't resist some
news here.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all, we've released a new Alpha, just today.<a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/install/alpha/blogbridge.jnlp"> You can get it here.
</a> The way we work
it is that if after a week or so of use there are no show stopped bugs, we
will promote the Alpha to a Beta. <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/projectpage.htm#releases">The general release model is described
here.</a></p>
<p>This new version has a ton of new feature stuff, plus major stability and
performance improvements. I dare say, we are getting close to having a Release
1.0 product. Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The BlogBridge Service gets a major new capability, which is RSS
Discovery Services. The change to the user experience is minimal but I would
say pretty significant. When you want to add a Feed, you don't need to hunt
for the RSS Feed URL, which our non-technical users won't even understand. You
just enter the URL for the Blog itself, that is, the one you read with a Web
Browser, and BlogBridge will attempt to 'discover' the RSS Feed. Behind the
scenes it spawns a process to talk to the BlogBridge Service to resolve it.
Try it, it's pretty cool!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second major new capability is the Feed Discovery Service. In it's
initial form, there is a new command on the Feed Menu: "Discover new Feeds".
Again working behind the scenes with the service, BlogBridge will analyze all
the articles in a certain Feed, to see whether any of them point to Blogs that
you don't know yet. If so, they are highlighted right in the article (let's
say in Red.) The user can right click on the link and in one step add that new
Feed to their subscription list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the smaller changes are, much better (although not yet perfect)
support of Mac OSX, a minor change to the menu structure and terminology based
on customer feedback, and numerous bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/update064.html">Here is a link to the announcement email we sent to our
users.</a><br />
Enjoy!</p>
